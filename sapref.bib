  abstract = {Speech Segmentation is the process change point detection for partitioning an input audio stream into regions each of which corresponds to only one audio source or one speaker. One application of this system is in Speaker Diarization systems. There are several methods for speaker segmentation; however, most of the Speaker Diarization Systems use BIC-based Segmentation methods. The main goal of this paper is to propose a new method for speaker segmentation with higher speed than the current methods - e.g. BIC and acceptable accuracy. Our proposed method is based on the pitch frequency of the speech. The accuracy of this method is similar to the accuracy of common speaker segmentation methods. However, its computation cost is much less than theirs. We show that our method is about 2.4 times faster than the BICbased method, while the average accuracy of pitch-based method is slightly higher than that of the BICbased method.},

This algorithm is evaluated against known state-of-the-art solutions. Our baseline method uses cepstral mean along signal blocks to acquire an estimation of the reverberation's impulse response which is analyzed with respect to its decay characteristics. Further improvements are a cepstral lifter to increase the method's performance by removing nonrelevant cepstral coefficients and a polynomial of second order to map the results onto final estimates. Results indicate larger deviations in the estimated decay times of late reverberations, while estimates for the early decay times are within the just noticable difference (JND) and deviate only slightly from the true values. State-of-the-art algorithms show small correlation with the true reverberation times.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, there are several telephone services based on IP networks. However, the networks can present many disturbances, such as packet loss rate (PLR), which is one of the most impairing network factors. An impaired speech communication affects the users' quality of experience; hence, the assessment of speech quality is relevant to the telephone operators. Therefore, the determination of a methodology to predict a speech quality with a higher accuracy in telephone services is relevant. In this context, this letter introduces a novel nonintrusive speech quality classifier (SQC) model based on deep belief networks (DBN), in which the support vector machine with radial basis function kernel is the classifier applied in DBN, in order to identify four speech quality classes. A speech database was built, based on unimpaired speech files of public databases, in which different PLR models and values are applied, and a standardized intrusive method is used to calculate the index quality of each file. Results show that SQC largely overcomes the results obtained by ITU-T Recommendation P.563. Also, subjective tests are performed to validate the SQC performance, and it reached an accuracy of 95\% on speech quality classification. Furthermore, a solution architecture is introduced, demonstrating the usefulness and flexibility of the proposed SQC.},

  abstract = {Objective speech intelligibility measures are gaining popularity in the development of speech enhancement algorithms and speech processing devices such as hearing aids. Such devices may process the input signals nonlinearly and modify the binaural cues presented to the user. We propose a method for predicting the intelligibility of noisy and nonlinearly processed binaural speech. This prediction is based on the noisy and processed signal as well as a clean speech reference signal. The method is obtained by extending a modified version of the short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) measure with a modified equalization-cancellation (EC) stage. We evaluate the performance of the method by comparing the predictions with measured intelligibility from four listening experiments. These comparisons indicate that the proposed measure can provide accurate predictions of (1) the intelligibility of diotic speech with an accuracy similar to that of the original STOI measure, (2) speech reception thresholds (SRTs) in conditions with a frontal target speaker and a single interferer in the horizontal plane, (3) SRTs in conditions with a frontal target and a single interferer when ideal time frequency segregation (ITFS) is applied to the left and right ears separately, and (4) the advantage of two-microphone beamforming as applied in state-of-the-art hearing aids. A MATLAB implementation of the proposed measure is available online1.},

  abstract = {Speech intelligibility prediction methods have recently gained popularity in the speech processing community as supplements to time consuming and costly lis- tening experiments. Such methods can be used to objectively quantify and compare the advantage of different speech enhancement algorithms, in a way that correlates well with actual speech intelligibility. One such method is the short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) measure. In a recent publication, we proposed a binaural version of the STOI measure, based on a modified version of the equalization cancellation (EC) model. This measure was shown to re- tain many of the advantageous properties of the STOI measure, while at the same time being able to predict intelligibility correctly in conditions involving both binaural advantage and non-linear signal processing. The biggest predic- tion errors were found for conditions involving multiple spatially distributed interferers. In this paper, we report results for a new listening experiment in- cluding different mixtures of isotropic and point source noise. This exposes that the binaural STOI measure has a tendency to overestimate the intelligibility in conditions with spatially distributed interferes at low signal to noise ratios (SNRs). This condition-dependent error can make it difficult to compare in- telligibility across different acoustical conditions. We investigate the cause of this upward bias, and propose a correction which alleviates the problem. The modified method is evaluated with five datasets of measured intelligibility, span- ning a wide range of realistic acoustic conditions. Within the tested conditions, the modified method yields very accurate predictions, and entirely alleviates the aforementioned tendency to overestimate intelligibility in conditions with spatially distributed interferers.},

  abstract = {Abstract Speech perception depends on access to spectral and temporal acoustic cues. Temporal cues include slowly varying amplitude changes (i.e. temporal envelope, TE) and quickly varying amplitude changes associated with the center frequency of the auditory filter (i.e. temporal fine structure, TFS). This study quantifies the effects of \{TFS\} randomization through noise vocoding on the perception of speech quality by parametrically varying the amount of original \{TFS\} available above 1500 Hz. The two research aims were: 1) to establish the role of \{TFS\} in quality perception, and 2) to determine if the role of \{TFS\} in quality perception differs between subjects with normal hearing and subjects with sensorineural hearing loss. Ratings were obtained from 20 subjects (10 with normal hearing and 10 with hearing loss) using an 11-point quality scale. Stimuli were processed in three different ways: 1) A 32-channel noise-excited vocoder with random envelope fluctuations in the noise carrier, 2) a 32-channel noise-excited vocoder with the noise-carrier envelope smoothed, and 3) removal of high-frequency bands. Stimuli were presented in quiet and in babble noise at 18 dB and 12 dB signal-to-noise ratios. \{TFS\} randomization had a measurable detrimental effect on quality ratings for speech in quiet and a smaller effect for speech in background babble. Subjects with normal hearing and subjects with sensorineural hearing loss provided similar quality ratings for noise-vocoded speech.}

  abstract = {Speaker diarization is the task of determining \~Awho spoke when?\~A in an audio or video recording that contains an unknown amount of speech and also an unknown number of speakers. Initially, it was proposed as a research topic related to automatic speech recognition, where speaker diarization serves as an upstream processing step. Over recent years, however, speaker diarization has become an important key technology for many tasks, such as navigation, retrieval, or higher level inference on audio data. Accordingly, many important improvements in accuracy and robustness have been reported in journals and conferences in the area. The application domains, from broadcast news, to lectures and meetings, vary greatly and pose different problems, such as having access to multiple microphones and multimodal information or overlapping speech. The most recent review of existing technology dates back to 2006 and focuses on the broadcast news domain. In this paper, we review the current state-of-the-art, focusing on research developed since 2006 that relates predominantly to speaker diarization for conference meetings. Finally, we present an analysis of speaker diarization performance as reported through the NIST Rich Transcription evaluations on meeting data and identify important areas for future research.},

  abstract = {There is a considerable evidence that our perception of sound uses important features which is related to underlying signal modulations. This topic has been studied extensively via perceptual experiments, yet there are few, if any, well-developed signal processing methods which capitalize on or model these effects. We begin by summarizing evidence of the importance of modulation representations from psychophysical, physiological, and other sources. The concept of a two-dimensional joint acoustic and modulation frequency representation is proposed. A simple single sinusoidal amplitude modulator of a sinusoidal carrier is then used to illustrate properties of an unconstrained and ideal joint representation. Added constraints are required to remove or reduce undesired interference terms and to provide invertibility. It is then noted that the constraints would also apply to more general and complex cases of broader modulation and carriers. Applications in single-channel speaker separation and in audio coding are used to illustrate the applicability of this joint representation. Other applications in signal analysis and filtering are suggested.},

The first part of the book is intended to serve as a textbook for a numerical linear algebra course. The material assumes the reader has a basic knowledge of linear algebra, such as set theory and matrix algebra, however it is demanding for students who are not afraid of theory. To assist the reader, the more difficult passages have been marked, the definitions for each chapter are collected at the beginning of the chapter, and numerous exercises are included throughout the text. The second part of the book serves as a monograph introducing recent results in the iterative solution of linear systems, mainly using preconditioned conjugate gradient methods. This book should be a valuable resource for students and researchers alike wishing to learn more about iterative methods.},

The algorithm models time-varying noise using a Hidden Markov Model and tracks changes in noise characteristics by a sequential model update procedure that incorporates a forgetting factor. In addition the algorithm will when necessary create new model states to represent novel noise spectra and will merge existing states that have similar characteristics. We demonstrate that the algorithm is able to track non-stationary noise effectively and show that, when it is incorporated into a standard speech enhancement algorithm, it results in enhanced speech with an improved PESQ score and lower residual noise.},

The goal is to perform this analysis blindly, that is without any other information than the recording itself. Considering the respective nature of the early and the late contributions of the room effect, two distinct tools, acting on a monophonic signal, are proposed to estimate the relevant information of each contribution. Then, the estimations of the early parts of the responses are simultaneously processed by a coincidence detector, in order to derive the binaural cues of the sound scene.},

  abstract = {The electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates of degraded speech perception have been explored in a number of recent studies. However, such investigations have often been inconclusive as to whether observed differences in brain responses between conditions result from different acoustic properties of more or less intelligible stimuli or whether they relate to cognitive processes implicated in comprehending challenging stimuli.In this study we used noise vocoding to spectrally degrade monosyllabic words in order to manipulate their intelligibility. We used spectral rotation to generate incomprehensible control conditions matched in terms of spectral detail. We recorded EEG from 14 volunteers who listened to a series of noise vocoded (NV) and noise-vocoded spectrally-rotated (rNV) words, while they carried out a detection task. We specifically sought components of the EEG response that showed an interaction between spectral rotation and spectral degradation. This reflects those aspects of the brain electrical response that are related to the intelligibility of acoustically degraded monosyllabic words, while controlling for spectral detail.An interaction between spectral complexity and rotation was apparent in both evoked and induced activity. Analyses of event-related potentials showed an interaction effect for a P300-like component at several centro-parietal electrodes. Time-frequency analysis of the EEG signal in the alpha-band revealed a monotonic increase in event-related desynchronization (ERD) for the NV but not the rNV stimuli in the alpha band at a left temporo-central electrode cluster from 420 -560ms reflecting a direct relationship between the strength of alpha-band ERD and intelligibility.By matching NV words with their incomprehensible rNV homologues, we reveal the spatio{$\lnot\spddot$}temporal pattern of evoked and induced processes involved in degraded speech perception, largely uncontaminated by purely acoustic effects.}

Prior research has shown that high levels of vibration cause a decrease in speech intelligibility. However, the effects of whole-body vibration upon speech are not well understood, and no attempt has been made to restore speech distorted by whole-body vibration. In this paper, a model for speech during whole-body vibration is proposed and a method to remove its effect is described. The method presented reduces the perceptual effects of vibration, yields higher automatic speech recognition accuracy scores, and may significantly improve intelligibility. Possible applications include incorporation within spaceflight, aviation, or off-road vehicle radio-communication systems.},

We show that all relevant performance measures for beamformer designs are functions of the coherence matrix of the noise field. Additionally, we present unconstrained and constrained MVDR-solutions using modified coherence functions. Solutions for different choices of the optimization criterion are given including a new solution to optimize the front-to-back ratio. Finally, we present a comparison of superdirective beamformers to gradient microphones and an alternative generalized sidelobe canceler (GSC) implementation of the superdirective beamformer.},

  abstract = {Electronically steerable arrays of microphones have a variety of uses in speech data acquisition systems. Applications include teleconferencing, speech recognition and speaker identification, sound capture in adverse environments, and biomedical devices for the hearing impaired. An array of microphones has a number of advantages over a single-microphone system. It may be electronically aimed to provide a high-quality signal from a desired source location while simultaneously attenuating interfering talkers and ambient noise, does not necessitate local placement of transducers or encumber the talker with a hand-held or head-mounted microphone, and does not require physical movement to alter its direction of reception. Additionally, it has capabilities that a single microphone does not; namely automatic detection, localization and tracking of active talkers in its receptive area. This paper addresses the specific application of source localization algorithms for estimating the position of speech sources in a real-room environment given limited computational resources. The theoretical foundations of a speech source localization system are presented. This includes the development of a source-sensor geometry for talkers and sensors in the near-field environment as well as the evaluation of several error criteria available to the problem. Several practical algorithms necessary for real-time implementation are developed, specifically the derivation and evaluation of an appropriate time-delay estimator and a novel closed-form locator. Finally, results obtained from a real system are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed source localization techniques as well as to confirm the practicality of the theoretical models.},

  abstract = {Reduction of late reverberation can be achieved using spatio-spectral filters, such as the multichannel Wiener filter. To compute this filter, an estimate of the late reverberation power spectral density (PSD) is required. In recent years, a multitude of late reverberation PSD estimators have been proposed. In this paper, these estimators are categorized into several classes, their relations and differences are discussed, and a comprehensive experimental comparison is provided. To compare their performance, simulations in controlled as well as practical scenarios are conducted. It is shown that a common weakness of spatial coherence-based estimators is their performance in high direct-to-diffuse ratio conditions. To mitigate this problem, a correction method is proposed and evaluated. It is shown that the proposed correction method can decrease the speech distortion without significantly affecting the reverberation reduction.}

Although this relationship was verified in later studies, the research has never led to a quantitative model. The advent of techniques for the generation of virtual sound sources has made it possible to study distance perception using controlled, deterministic stimuli. Here we present two experiments that make use of such stimuli and we show that a simple model, based on a modified direct-to-reverberant energy ratio, can accurately predict the results and also provide an explanation for the 'auditory horizon' in distance perception. The modification of the ratio consists of the use of an integration time of 6 milliseconds in the calculation of the energy of the direct sound. This time constant seems to be important in spatial hearing\~A\textcent\^A\^Athe precedence effect is also based on a similar integration window.},

This model cannot explain, however, why distance perception depends on the presence of lateral reflections. Better results can be obtained with another model, which supposes that the (incomplete) separation of direct and reverberant energy is performed by the binaural system.},

  abstract = {The Centre for Law Enforcement Audio Research (CLEAR) was established by the Home Office Scientific Development Branch in 2007 and is based at Imperial College London and University College London. The objectives of CLEAR are to:  {$\cdot$}be a centre of excellence in the fields of speech cleaning and recovery in the context of law enforcement.  {$\cdot$}be able to offer specialist advice to companies and organizations working in the field.  {$\cdot$}conduct world-class research in speech cleaning and related areas.  {$\cdot$}maintain up-to-date knowledge of speech cleaning algorithms and the capabilities of speech cleaning products.  {$\cdot$}offer appropriate training to those entering or already working in the field.  The first part of this talk will describe the scope of the CLEAR project and will present an overview of its ongoing research activities and their relevance to the Law Enforcement community.  The second part of the talk will describe two of our current research projects in more detail. The first of these is aimed at improving quality and intelligibility through the automatic equalization of speech recordings either in real-time or off-line. The tonal balance of a speech recording can be degraded by several factors including the recording apparatus and the microphone characteristics together with its positioning and its acoustic environment. We will describe the techniques we have developed to compensate automatically for these effects in order to restore the correct tonal balance of the speech signal and we will illustrate these with examples. Because so many different speech cleaning methods exist, it can be difficult for a practitioner to decide the most appropriate way to enhance a degraded signal. One of the goals of CLEAR is to develop tools that are able to diagnose a signal automatically and to recommend which speech cleaning procedures to apply. In pursuit of this goal, we are constructing a systematic set of relationships between specific speech signal degradations, the vocabulary used to describe their effects and the speech cleaning methods that are effective against them. As part of this process, we have developed a tool that is able to synthesise a wide range of degraded speech signals with known characteristics. We will illustrate the use of this tool and explain how we plan to use it to develop automatic diagnosis capabilities.  In a companion talk, members of the CLEAR team will describe the work we have done on understanding the impact of digital processing on the intelligibility and quality of noisy speech in law-enforcement applications.},

  abstract = {The starting point in the formulation of most acoustic problems is the acoustic wave equation. Those most widely used, the classical and convected wave equations, have significant restrictions, i.e., apply only to linear, nondissipative sound waves in a steady homogeneous medium at rest or in uniform motion. There are many practical situations violating these severe restrictions. In the present paper 36 distinct forms of the acoustic wave equation are derived (and numbered W1\textendash W36), extending the classical and convected wave equations to include cases of propagation in inhomogeneous and/or unsteady media, either at rest or in potential or vortical flows. The cases considered include: (i) linear waves, i.e., with small gradients, which imply small amplitudes, and (ii) nonlinear waves, i.e., with steep gradients, which include ``ripples'' (large gradients with small amplitude) or large amplitude waves. Only nondissipative waves are considered, i.e., excluding and dissipation by shear and bulk viscosity and thermal conduction. Consideration is given to propagation in homogeneous media and inhomogeneous media, which are homentropic (i.e., have uniform entropy) or isentropic (i.e., entropy is conserved along streamlines), excluding nonisentropic (e.g., dissipative); unsteady media are also considered. The medium may be at rest, in uniform motion, or it may be a nonuniform and/or unsteady mean flow, including: (i) potential mean flow, of low Mach number (i.e., incompressible mean state) or of high-speed (i.e., inhomogeneous compressible mean flow); (ii) quasi-one-dimensional propagation in ducts of varying cross section, including horns without mean flow and nozzles with low or high Mach number mean flow; or (iii) unidirectional sheared mean flow, in the plane, in space or axisymmetric. Other types of vortical mean flows, e.g., axisymmetric swirling mean flow, possibly combined with shear, are not considered in the present paper (and are left to follow-up work together with dissipative and other cases). The 36 wave equations are derived either by elimination among the general equations of fluid mechanics or from an acoustic variational principle, with both methods being used in a number of cases as cross-checks. Although the 36 forms of the acoustic wave equation do not cover all possible combinations of the three effects of (i) nonlinearity in (ii) inhomogeneous and unsteady and (iii) nonuniformly moving media, they do include each effect in isolation and a variety of combinations of multiple effects. Altogether they provide a useful variety of extensions of the classical (and convected) wave equations, which are used widely in the literature, in spite of being restricted to linear, nondissipative sound waves in an homogeneous steady medium at rest (or in uniform motion). There are many applications for which the classical and convected wave equations are poor approximations, and more general forms of the acoustic wave equation provide more satisfactory models. Numerous examples of these applications are given at the end of each written section. There are 240 references cited in this review article.}

  abstract = {Conventional wisdom and common practice in acquisition and reconstruction of images from frequency data follow the basic principle of the Nyquist density sampling theory. This principle states that to reconstruct an image, the number of Fourier samples we need to acquire must match the desired resolution of the image, i.e. the number of pixels in the image. This paper surveys an emerging theory which goes by the name of `compressive sampling' or `compressed sensing' and which says that this conventional wisdom is inaccurate. Perhaps surprisingly, it is possible to reconstruct images or signals of scientific interest accurately and sometimes even exactly from a number of samples which is far smaller than the desired resolution of the image/signal, e.g. the number of pixels in the image. It is believed that compressive sampling has far reaching implications. For example, it suggests the possibility of new data acquisition protocols that translate analog information into digital form with fewer sensors than what was considered necessary. This new sampling theory may come to underlie procedures for sampling and compressing data simultaneously. In this short survey, we provide some of the key mathematical insights underlying this new theory, and explain some of the interactions between compressive sampling and other fields such as statistics, information theory, coding theory, and theoretical computer science.},

In the field of data conversion, standard analog-to-digital converter (ADC) technology implements the usual quantized Shannon representation - the signal is uniformly sampled at or above the Nyquist rate. This article surveys the theory of compressive sampling, also known as compressed sensing or CS, a novel sensing/sampling paradigm that goes against the common wisdom in data acquisition. CS theory asserts that one can recover certain signals and images from far fewer samples or measurements than traditional methods use.},

The frequency-wavenumber power spectral density provides the mean-square value for the amplitudes of these waves and is of considerable importance in the analysis of propagating waves by means of an array of sensors. The conventional method of frequency-wavenumber power spectral density estimation uses a fixed-wavenumber window and its resolution is determined essentially by the beam pattern of the array of sensors. A high-resolution method of estimation is introduced which employs a wavenumber window whose shape changes and is a function of the wavenumber at which an estimate is obtained. It is shown that the wavenumber resolution of this method is considerably better than that of the conventional method. Application of these results is given to seismic data obtained from the large aperture seismic array located in eastern Montana. In addition, the application of the high-resolution method to other areas, such as radar, sonar, and radio astronomy, is indicated.},

This contribution proposes a system consisting of a commonly used combination of a beamformer with a single-channel speech enhancement scheme aiming at joint dereverberation and noise reduction. First, a minimum variance distortionless response beamformer with an on-line estimated noise coherence matrix is used to suppress the noise and possibly some reflections. The beamformer output is then processed by a single-channel speech enhancement scheme, incorporating temporal cepstrum smoothing which suppresses both reverberation and residual noise. Experimental results show that improvements are particularly significant in conditions with high reverberation times.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with speaker-adaptive speech recognition for large spoken archives. The goal is to improve the recognition accuracy of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that is being deployed for transcription of a large archive of Czech radio. This archive represents a significant part of Czech cultural heritage, as it contains recordings covering 90years of broadcasting. A large portion of these documents (100,000h) is to be transcribed and made public for browsing. To improve the transcription results, an efficient speaker-adaptive scheme is proposed. The scheme is based on integration of speaker diarization and adaptation methods and is designed to achieve a low Real-Time Factor (RTF) of the entire adaptation process, because the archive's size is enormous. It thus employs just two decoding passes, where the first one is carried out using the lexicon with a reduced number of items. Moreover, the transcripts from the first pass serve not only for adaptation, but also as the input to the speaker diarization module, which employs two-stage clustering. The output of diarization is then utilized for a cluster-based unsupervised Speaker Adaptation (SA) approach that also utilizes information based on the gender of each individual speaker. Presented experimental results on various types of programs show that our adaptation scheme yields a significant Word Error Rate (WER) reduction from 22.24\% to 18.85\% over the Speaker Independent (SI) system while operating at a reasonable RTF.},

  abstract = {A Bayesian approach to spatial filtering is presented, which is robust to uncertain or erroneous direction-of-arrival (DOA) information. The proposed framework aims to capture multiple sound sources at each time-frequency instant with an arbitrary direction-dependent gain, while attenuating diffuse sound and noise. For robustness, the DOA corresponding to each sound source is assumed to be a discrete random variable with a prior defined on a discrete set of candidate DOAs over the whole DOA space. With this assumption, the desired spatial filter is given as a weighted sum of spatial filters corresponding to a specific combination of probable DOA values, where the weights are given by the joint posterior probabilities of the combination of DOA values. Assuming the whole DOA space as the support for each random variable results in redundant computations and contributes to a high computational cost. To alleviate this problem, a narrowband DOA estimate-based posterior probability approximation method is proposed, which isolates regions in the DOA space with high probability of containing the actual source DOAs to compute time-adaptive supports for each random variable. Through experimental analysis, we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed framework against DOA estimation errors. Experimental evaluation with simulated and measured room impulse responses, in terms of objective performance measures, demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework to perform spatial filtering in noisy and reverberant acoustic environments.},

We base our estimation on a theoretical relationship between the DRR and the coherence estimation function between coincident pressure and particle velocity. We discuss the proposed method'\~A\^As ability to estimate the DRR in a wide variety of room sizes, reverberation times and source receiver distances with appropriate examples. Test results show that the method can estimate the room DRR for frequencies between 100 - 3200 Hz, with pm5 dB accuracy.},

Since HRTFs vary as a function of the relative source location and subject, practical implementation of 3D audio must take into account a large set of HRTFs for different azimuths and elevations. Previous work has proposed several HRTF models for data reduction. This paper describes our work in applying genetic algorithms to find a set of HRTF basis spectra, and the normal equation method to compute the optimal combination of linear weights to represent the individual HRTFs at different azimuths and elevations. The genetic algorithm selects the basis spectra from the set of original HRTF amplitude responses, using an average relative spectral error as the fitness function. Encouraging results from the experiments suggest that genetic algorithms provide an effective approach to this data reduction problem.},

We begin with an optimized method for the blind estimation of the reverberation time, in the presence of additive noise and we further adapt it to better serve the forensic context. Next we present several experiments which validate, through objective measurements, the estimation method we used. Finally we propose different scenarios in which we underline the opportunity to use reverberation time as a mean of detecting audio editing in a recording. The results of our incipient study showed that, within controlled conditions, the reverberation time parameter can be successfully used for detecting the existence of audio editing traces in a recording.},

Detailed mathematical derivations are presented throughout, with thorough explanation of the key results and all fundamental lemmas required for the reader to derive similar calculus on their own. These core theoretical concepts are then applied to a wide range of real-world problems in signal processing and wireless communications, including performance analysis of CDMA, MIMO and multi-cell networks, as well as signal detection and estimation in cognitive radio networks. The rigorous yet intuitive style helps demonstrate to students and researchers alike how to choose the correct approach for obtaining mathematically accurate results.},

This test of intelligibility of everyday speech has been developed primarily for use as a criterion measure in investigations of hearing aid benefit. The test consists of 48 passages of conversationally produced connected speech. Each passage contains 25 key words for scoring. All passages are of equal intelligibility for the average normal hearer. Key words vary in intelligibility within a passage but span the same intelligibility range in all passages. Several passages are administered, and the results averaged, to yield a single intelligibility score. For pairs of scores, each based on mean performance across 4 randomly-chosen passages, the 95\% critical difference is estimated to be about 14 rationalized arcsine units (rau). The performance-intensity function for the CST has a slope of 12 rau/dB signal-to-babble ratio. Investigations of the test are continuing with hearing-impaired listeners.},

In this study, speech utterances are restricted to pronounced digits; uncontrolled discourse is not considered. The reverberation times considered are wide band, within the frequency range of speech utterances. A multilayer feed forward neural network is trained on speech examples with known reverberation times generated by a room simulator. The speech signals are preprocessed by calculating short-term RMS values. A second decision-based neural network is added to improve the reliability of the predictions. In the retrieve phase, the trained neural networks extract room reverberation times from speech signals picked up in the rooms to an accuracy of 0.1 s. This provides an alternative to traditional measurement methods and facilitates the occupied measurement of room reverberation times.},

Both hearing-impaired and normal-hearing subject groups showed progressively higher SRTs with increasing levels of peak clipping, with significant threshold shifts occurring for clipping levels greater than 18 to 24 dB. Neither subject group showed significantly elevated SRTs for the compression processed stimuli. Magnitude-squared coherence analysis of the speech stimuli revealed high levels of distortion generated by peak clipping and relatively low levels generated by the compression processing. Subsequent analysis suggested that the addition of distortion products and not the alteration of the speech waveform envelope was responsible for the observed threshold shifts, and that coherence analysis may be a valuable tool for predicting the effects of distortion on speech intelligibility. Judgments of sound quality showed that the clipping level where SRTs began to be significantly affected coincided with the clipping level at which the quality of the speech was judged to be unacceptable.},

  abstract = {Synopsis: The frequency distribution of energy in speech has been determined for six speakers, four men and two women, for a 50-syllable sentence of connected speech, and also for a list of 50 disconnected syllables. The speech was received by a condenser transmitter whose voltage output, amplified 3,000 fold, was impressed on the grids of twin single stage amplifiers. The unmodified output of one of these amplifiers was measured by a thermocouple and was a known function of the total energy received by the transmitter, corrections being made for the slight variation with frequency of the response of the circuit. The output of the other amplifier was limited by a series resonant circuit to a narrow band of frequencies, the energy in this band being measured by a second thermocouple. The damping of the resonant circuit was so chosen that sufficient resolving power and sufficient energy, sensitiveness were obtained over the range from 75 to 5,000 cycles per second; and 23 frequency settings were made to cover this range. For each syllable simultaneous readings were recorded on the two thermocouples at each frequency setting. The consecutive syllables were pronounced deliberately by each speaker, maintaining as nearly as possible the normal modulation of the voice. Corrections were applied to offset the unavoidable variations in total energy incidental to repetition of a given syllable. 13,800 observations were made for all speakers. The energy distribution curves obtained are essentially the same for connected as for disconnected speech, and indicate that differences between individuals are more important than variations due to the particular test material chosen. A composite curve drawn from the individual curves shows a great concentration of speech energy in the low frequencies, a result which would not be expected from data previously published by others. The actual results contain a factor due to standing waves between the speaker's mouth and the transmitter, a complication always present in telephoning; this could not be eliminated.The rate of energy output in speech for the normally modulated voice, was determined from the readings for total energy and was found to be about 125 ergs per second.},

The corpus is composed of several sequences obtained by convolution of dry acoustic events with more than 9000 impulse responses measured in a real apartment equipped with 40 microphones. The acoustic events include in-domain sentences of different typologies uttered by native speakers in four different languages and non-speech events representing typical domestic noises. To increase the realism of the resulting corpus, background noises were recorded in the real home environment and then added to the generated sequences. The purpose of this work is to describe the simulation procedure and the data sets that were created and used to derive the corpus. The corpus contains signals of different characteristics making it suitable for various multi-microphone signal processing and distant speech recognition tasks.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art hearing prostheses are equipped with acoustic noise reduction algorithms to improve speech intelligibility. Currently, one of the major challenges is to perform acoustic noise reduction in so-called cocktail party scenarios with multiple speakers, in particular because it is difficult-if not impossible-for the algorithm to determine which are the target speaker(s) that should be enhanced, and which speaker(s) should be treated as interfering sources. Recently, it has been shown that electroencephalography (EEG) can be used to perform auditory attention detection, i.e., to detect to which speaker a subject is attending based on recordings of neural activity. In this paper, we combine such an EEG-based auditory attention detection (AAD) paradigm with an acoustic noise reduction algorithm based on the multi-channel Wiener filter (MWF), leading to a neuro-steered MWF. In particular, we analyze how the AAD accuracy affects the noise suppression performance of an adaptive MWF in a sliding-window implementation, where the user switches his attention between two speakers.},

The model combines a series of preprocessing stages with an optimal detector as the decision device. The present paper gives a description of the various preprocessing stages and of the implementation of the optimal detector. The output of the preprocessing stages is a time-varying activity pattern to which textquotelefttextquoteleftinternal noisetextquoterighttextquoteright is added. In the decision process, a stored temporal representation of the signal to be detected (template) is compared with the actual activity pattern. The comparison amounts to calculating the correlation between the two temporal patterns and is comparable to a textquotelefttextquoteleftmatched filteringtextquoterighttextquoteright process. The detector itself derives the template at the beginning of each simulated threshold measurement from a suprathreshold value of the stimulus. The model allows one to estimate thresholds with the same signals and psychophysical procedures as those used in actual experiments. In the accompanying paper [Dau et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 99, - (1996)] data obtained for human observers are compared with the optimal-detector model for various masking conditions.},

  abstract = {This and the accompanying paper [Dau et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 99, - (1996)] describe a quantitative model for signal processing in the auditory system. The model combines several stages of preprocessing with a decision device that has the properties of an optimal detector. The present paper compares model predictions for a variety of experimental conditions with the performance of human observers. Simulated and psychophysically determined thresholds were estimated with a three-interval forced-choice adaptive procedure. All model parameters were kept constant for all simulations discussed in this paper. For frozen-noise maskers, the effects of the following stimulus parameters were examined: signal frequency, signal phase, temporal position and duration of the signal within the masker under conditions of simultaneous masking, masker level, and masker duration under conditions of forward masking, and backward masking. The influence of signal phase and the temporal position of the signal, including positions at masker onset, was determined for a random-noise masker and compared with corresponding results obtained for a frozen noise. The model describes all the experimental data with an accuracy of a few dB with the following exceptions: forward-masked thresholds obtained with brief maskers are too high and the change in threshold with a change in signal duration is too small. Both discrepancies have their origin in the adaptation stages in the preprocessing part of the model. On the basis of the wide range of simulated conditions we conclude that the present model is a successful approach to describing the detection process in the human auditory system.},

The method has been widely used in acoustics to model the reverberant field of rectangular rooms, but can also be used for general-shaped rooms and nonflat reflectors. This paper explores the relationship between the physical properties of a non-flat reflector and the statistical properties of the associated cloud of image-sources. It is shown here that the standard deviation of the image-sources is strongly correlated with the ratio between depth and width of the reflector's spatial features.}

The kernel method and the Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) are introduced to the proposed method. First, the clipping and non-clipping feature parameters are extracted using MDCT coefficients of audio signals. Next, the optimal projection vector and the classification threshold are obtained by training KFD based on the extracted feature parameters. Finally, the decision rule of KFD is employed to detect the clipping distortion. The test results indicate that the proposed algorithm yields good clipping detection result, the performance is better than the reference method.},

A common measure is the (frequency-dependent) reverberation time T60. Explicit measurement using sound excitations is not possible for most applications, therefore blind estimation of subband T60 from speech signals is employed. Previous approaches are either limited to T60 between 0...1.5 s, or require long speech signals and costly computation. We propose an efficient algorithm that estimates T60 up to 6 s from short speech signals of no more than 20 s. In experiments with real room impulse responses (RIR) the algorithm exhibits state-of-the-art performance for T60 up to 1.5 s and superior performance for longer T60.},

  abstract = {The cortical representation of the acoustic features of continuous speech is the foundation of speech perception. In this study, noninvasive magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings are obtained from human subjects actively listening to spoken narratives, in both simple and cocktail party-like auditory scenes. By modeling how acoustic features of speech are encoded in ongoing MEG activity as a spectrotemporal response function, we demonstrate that the slow temporal modulations of speech in a broad spectral region are represented bilaterally in auditory cortex by a phase-locked temporal code. For speech presented monaurally to either ear, this phase-locked response is always more faithful in the right hemisphere, but with a shorter latency in the hemisphere contralateral to the stimulated ear. When different spoken narratives are presented to each ear simultaneously (dichotic listening), the resulting cortical neural activity precisely encodes the acoustic features of both of the spoken narratives, but slightly weakened and delayed compared with the monaural response. Critically, the early sensory response to the attended speech is considerably stronger than that to the unattended speech, demonstrating top-down attentional gain control. This attentional gain is substantial even during the subjectstextquoteright very first exposure to the speech mixture and therefore largely independent of knowledge of the speech content. Together, these findings characterize how the spectrotemporal features of speech are encoded in human auditory cortex and establish a single-trial-based paradigm to study the neural basis underlying the cocktail party phenomenon.}

  abstract = {The reverberation time or RT60 is an essential acoustic parameter of a room. In many situations, the room impulse response (RIR) is not available and the RT60 must be blindly estimated from a speech or music signal. Current methods often implicitly assume that reverberation dominates direct sound, which restricts their applicability to relatively small rooms or distant sound sources. This paper features two contributions. Firstly, we propose a blind RT60 estimation method that is independent of the room size and the source distance by preprocessing the input signal using a beamformer to cancel direct sound and early echoes. Secondly, we perform the largest experimental evaluation to our knowledge using a set of 342 RIRs. We show that the estimation error is significantly reduced even in the case when reverberation dominates.},

A block ofNsamples (typicallyN cong 10) is searched for the sample having the largest magnitude, and each sample in the block is then reencoded to a nearly uniform quantization having (n - 2) bits and an overload point at the top of the chord of the maximum sample. Since an encoding of this chord must be sent to the receiver along with the uniform reencoding, the resulting bit rate isf_{s}(n -2 + 3/N)bits/s where fsis the sampling rate. The algorithm can be viewed as an adaptive PCM algorithm that is compatible with the widely used μ-law andA-law companded PCM. Theoretical and empirical evidence is presented which indicates a performance slightly better than (n - 1) bit companded PCM (the bit rate is close to that of (n - 2) bit PCM). A feature which distinguishes NIC from most other bit-rate reduction techniques is a performance that is largely insensitive to the statistics of the input signal.},

It can provide information about the acoustic environment, the intelligibility, and quality of speech recorded in the room, and help improve the performance of speech processing algorithms with reverberant speech. Where the acoustic impulse response of the room is not available, the T60 must be estimated non-intrusively from reverberant speech. State-of-the-art non-intrusive T60 estimators have been shown to be strongly biased in the presence of noise. We describe a novel T60 estimation algorithm based on spectral decay distributions that provides robustness to additive noise for a range of realistic noise types for signal-to-noise ratios in the range 0 to 35 dB and T60s between 200 and 950 ms. The proposed method also has much reduced computational cost.},

This often leads to the signal exceeding the input limit of the equipment resulting in clipping. Communications devices typically rely on codecs such as GSM 06.10 to compress voice signals into lower bitrates. Detecting clipping in a hard-clipped speech signal is straightforward due to the characteristic flattening of the peaks of the waveform, this is not the case for speech that has subsequently passed through a codec. We describe a novel clipping detection algorithm based on amplitude histogram analysis and least squares residuals which can estimate the clipped samples and the original signal level in speech even after the clipped speech has been perceptually coded},

Assessing the effectiveness of deverberation algorithms using subjective listening tests is extremely time consuming and depends on averaging out listener variations over a large number of subjects. Also, most existing instrumental measures are intrusive and require knowledge of the original signal which precludes many practical applications. In this paper we show that the proposed non-intrusive single-channel algorithm is a predictor of the perceived level of reverberation that correlates well with subjective listening test results, outperforming many existing intrusive and non-intrusive measures. The algorithm requires only a single training step and has a very low computational complexity making it suitable for hearing aids and mobile telephone applications.

  abstract = {A sensitivity analysis of two distortionless beamformers is presented in this paper. Specifically, two well-known variants, namely the minimum power distortionless response (MPDR) and minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformers, are considered. In our scenario, which is typical to many modern communications systems, waves emitted by multiple point sources are received by an antenna array. An analytical expression for the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) improvement obtained by both beamformers under steering errors is derived. These expression are experimentally evaluated and compared with the robust Capon beamformer (RCB), a robust variant of the MPDR beamformer. We show that the MVDR beamformer, which uses the noise correlation matrix in its minimization criterion, is more robust to steering errors than its counterparts, that use the received signal correlation matrix. Furthermore, even if the noise correlation matrix is erroneously estimated due to steering errors in the interference direction, the MVDR advantage is still maintained for reasonable range of steering errors. These conclusions conform with Cox findings. Only line of sight propagation regime is considered in the current contribution. Ongoing research extends this work to fading channels.},

  abstract = {Characterizing sound field diffuseness has many practical applications, from room acoustics analysis to speech enhancement and sound field reproduction. In this paper, we investigate how spherical microphone arrays (SMAs) can be used to characterize diffuseness. Due to their specific geometry, SMAs are particularly well suited for analyzing the spatial properties of sound fields. In particular, the signals recorded by an SMA can be analyzed in the spherical harmonic (SH) domain, which has special and desirable mathematical properties when it comes to analyzing diffuse sound fields. We present a new measure of diffuseness, the COMEDIE diffuseness estimate, which is based on the analysis of the SH signal covariance matrix. This algorithm is suited for the estimation of diffuseness arising either from the presence of multiple sources distributed around the SMA or from the presence of a diffuse noise background. As well, we introduce the concept of a diffuseness profile, which consists in measuring the diffuseness for several SH orders simultaneously. Experimental results indicate that diffuseness profiles better describe the properties of the sound field than a single diffuseness measurement.}

The estimator is designed by minimizing the signal distortion while maintaining the residual noise level below some given threshold. The estimator is shown to be a Wiener filter with adjustable input noise level. This level is determined by the threshold of the permissible residual noise. The estimator is implemented using the signal subspace approach. The vector space of the noisy signal is decomposed into a signal subspace and complementary orthogonal noise subspace. Estimation is performed from vectors in the signal subspace only, since the orthogonal subspace does not contain signal information. The proposed estimator is shown to be a refinement of a version of the spectral subtraction signal estimator. The latter estimator is shown to be asymptotically optimal for stationary signal and noise in the linear minimum mean square error sense.},

  abstract = {This paper considers estimation of the noise spectral variance from speech signals contaminated by highly nonstationary noise sources. The method can accurately track fast changes in noise power level (up to about 10 dB/s). In each time frame, for each frequency bin, the noise variance estimate is updated recursively with the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimate of the current noise power. A time- and frequency-dependent smoothing parameter is used, which is varied according to an estimate of speech presence probability. In this way, the amount of speech power leaking into the noise estimates is kept low. For the estimation of the noise power, a spectral gain function is used, which is found by an iterative data-driven training method. The proposed noise tracking method is tested on various stationary and nonstationary noise sources, for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios, and compared with two state-of-the-art methods. When used in a speech enhancement system, improvements in segmental signal-to-noise ratio of more than 1 dB can be obtained for the most nonstationary noise sources at high noise levels.},

  abstract = {Distributed acoustic tracking estimates the trajectories of source positions using an acoustic sensor network. As it is often difficult to estimate the source-sensor range from individual nodes, the source positions have to be inferred from the direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimates. Due to reverberation and noise, the sound field becomes increasingly diffuse with increasing source-sensor distance, leading to a decreased Direction of Arrival (DoA)-estimation accuracy. To distinguish between accurate and uncertain DoA estimates, this letter proposes to incorporate the coherent-to-diffuse ratio as a measure of DoA reliability for single-source tracking. It is shown that the source positions, therefore, can be probabilistically triangulated by exploiting the spatial diversity of all nodes.}

The representation is obtained by means of an auditory-inspired filterbank analysis of temporal envelopes of the speech signal. Modulation spectral cues are used to develop an adaptive measure which is shown to correlate well with subjective ratings of overall quality, colouration, and reverberation tail effects. The performance of the proposed measure is compared to that of four state-of-the-art quality measurement algorithms. Experiments show that substantial improvement is attained, in particular for reverberant speech enhanced by a delay-and-sum beamformer.}

In particular, estimators of room reverberation time (T\textsubscript{60}) and direct-to-reverberant energy ratio (DRR) are proposed. Short-term temporal dynamic information is obtained from differential (delta) cepstral coefficients. The statistics computed from the zeroth-order delta cepstral sequence serve as input features to a support vector T\textsubscript{60} estimator. Long-term temporal dynamic cues, on the other hand, are obtained from an auditory spectrotemporal representation of speech commonly referred to as modulation spectrum. A measure termed as reverberation-to-speech modulation energy ratio, which is computed per modulation frequency band, is proposed and serves as input to T\textsubscript{60} and DRR estimators. Experiments show that the proposed estimators outperform a baseline system in scenarios involving reverberant speech with and without the presence of acoustic background noise. Experiments also suggest that estimators of subjective perception of spectral coloration, reverberant tail effect, and overall speech quality can be obtained with an adaptive speech-to-reverberation modulation energy ratio measure.},

It is shown that the variation of the clipped Gaussian noise spectrum is 5 percent, while the normalized cross-correlation function is 0.80; the results are extended to more general cases. A property of the conditional mean value of speech signals is derived. A typical value of the normalized intelligibility of clipped speech in the presence of noise is 0.70 for S/N = 3 dB; assuming the ear is a clipper, theoretical results are well in agreement. The existence of an intelligibility threshold is shown. The need for information on the envelope (or dynamics) of the speech wave to meet the requirement of naturalness is underlined.},

The primary problems of estimation as applied to the true direction, and the precision of observations, are discussed in the subcases which arise. The simultaneous distribution of the amplitude and direction of the vector sum of a number of random unit vectors of given precision, is demonstrated. From this is derived the test of significance appropriate to a worker whose knowledge of precision lies entirely in the internal evidence of the sample. This is the analogue of 'Student's' test in the Gaussian theory of errors. The general formulae obtained are illustrated using measurements of the direction of remanent magnetization in the directly and inversely magnetized lava flows obtained in Iceland by Mr J. Hospers.},

Unfortunately, a considerable drawback of the Constant Q Transform is that there is no inverse transform. Here we show it is possible to obtain a good quality approximate inverse to the Constant Q transform provided that the signal to be inverted has a sparse representation in the Discrete Fourier transform domain. This inverse is obtained through the use of lo and l1 minimisation approaches to project the signal from the constant Q domain back to the Discrete Fourier Transform domain. Once the signal has been projected back to the Discrete Fourier Transform domain, the signal can be recovered by performin and inverse Discrete Fourier Transform.},

  url = {http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/3604/},
  abstract = {The technique of synthetic aperture imaging is well applied in radar to produce images with high along-track resolution. However, when applied in sonar imaging, maintaining phase coherence across the length of the synthetic aperture had proven to be the greatest challenge due to the relatively much slower speed of sound waves and the instability inherent in an underwater towed platform.  This work aims to study, analytically and experimentally, the potential of reconstructing synthetic aperture images, by the exact reconstruction algorithm in the time-domain, without the use of phase information. The absence of phase information results in images with a relatively lower along-track resolution. However, the benefits of hardware simplicity and higher mapping rate, not present with the use of side-scan sonar, are still enjoyed. In addition, greater flexibility and robustness is achieved as compared to a coherent synthetic aperture system. This is manifested in its resilience to path deviations, tolerance to sparse arrangement of elements in the aperture, and consequently higher achievable mapping rate. Software simulations were performed to study the impact of key parameters on the performance of an incoherent synthetic aperture system. Concepts such as the point-target energy response and signal to self-noise ratio were formed, which led to the formulation of design methodologies and tools for such a system. A novel algorithm is introduced to address the problems of false targets and long processing time. A new bulk motion compensation method is presented for situations where large path deviations cause severe image degradation and compensation is necessary. This technique, together with the algorithms developed in this work, was implemented with data from a sea-survey of the Aeolian Sky wreck. Results gave a positive indication of the theoretical frameworks established. This technique was then extended to achieve 3-D imaging capability. Results from laboratory tank trials that were carried out were encouraging, and led to the development of an original concept of incoherent synthetic aperture synthesis that is practical, robust, economical, and has 3-D imaging capability.},

This paper presents a system to retrieve audio documents by acoustic similarity. The similarity measure is based on statistics derived from a supervised vector quantizer, rather than matching simple pitch or spectral characteristics. The system is thus able to learn distinguishing audio features while ignoring unimportant variation. Both theoretical and experimental results are presented, including quantitative measures of retrieval performance. Retrieval was tested on a corpus of simple sounds as well as a corpus of musical excerpts. The system is purely data-driven and does not depend on particular audio characteristics. Given a suitable parameterization, this method may thus be applicable to image retrieval as well.},

  abstract = {The LR transformation, due to Rutishauser, has proved to be a powerful method for finding the eigenvalues of symmetric band matrices. Little attention, however, has been paid to its application to the more difficult problem of finding eigenvalues of general unsymmetric matrices. If the matrices are large two important difficulties are likely to occur. Firstly, triangular decomposition, which is the basis of the method, is by no means always numerically stable, and secondly, the amount of computation required by the method is likely to be very great. This paper describes an algorithm similar to the LR transformation except that the transformations involved in it are all unitary and can thus be expected to by numerically stable. It is then shown that there are various advantages in first converting the matrix to almost-triangular form; in particular, the amount of work involved in the algorithm can then be greatly reduced.Part 1 of the paper is largely concerned with proof of convergence, and the theoretical aspect. Part 2, to be published in January, discussed practical computation and gives results of experiments.},

  abstract = {The QR transformation is an analogue to the LR transformation (Rutishauser, 1958) based on unitary transformations. Both these transformations are global iterative methods for finding the eigenvalues of a matrix, the matrix converging in general to triangular form. In Par t1 of this paper the QR transformation was briefly described and we were then principally concerned with proving convergence, the main result being expressed in theorem 3. We also showed that if the matrix is first reduced to almost triangular form important advantages are gained (further advantages will become apparent) and we gave in outline a way in which convergence could be improved. In this part of the paper we consider the practical application of the QR transformation. Two versions of the algorithm have been programmed for the Pegasus computer; these are described and an attempt is made to evaluate the method. Some results and detailed algorithms are given in appendices. Part 1 was published on pp. 265--271 of this volume (Oct. 61).},

ADC clipping can be detected by searching for consecutive minimum and maximum values in a signal. Quantization noise can be expressed as a signal-to-quantization noise ratio which is estimated from the smallest observable step size in the signal. Amplifier saturation is quantified using a normality test, as amplifier saturation will reduce the normality of the signal amplitude distribution. Experimental results, using simulated sEMG, demonstrate the successful application of these methods.},

  abstract = {The scattering of electromagnetic waves from rough surfaces has been actively studied for more than a century now because of its involvement in vast application areas. In the past two decades, great advances have been made by incorporating multiple scattering effects into analytical approaches. However, no model can yet be applied to surfaces with arbitrary roughness. It is also very difficult to study the cross-polarization, shadowing, or multiple scattering effects. In order to study more fundamentally the interaction of polarized light with more general rough surfaces of general media, we have developed a rigorous numerical simulator to calculate the resulting speckle fields. The full Maxwell equations were solved using surface integral equations combined with a boundary element method. The rough surface was discretized by higher order quadrilateral edge elements. The effective tangential electric and magnetic fields in each element in terms of 10 edges were first solved. The scattered electric and magnetic fields everywhere in space were then calculated correspondingly. One of the great advantages of such a simulator is that both the near and far fields can be calculated directly. Preliminary results of different kinds of metallic structures are presented, by which the advantages of the method are demonstrated.},

Although various techniques against degradation of the ASR performance have been proposed, it is difficult to properly apply them in evaluation environments with unknown noisy and reverberant conditions. It is possible to properly apply these techniques for improving the ASR performance if we can estimate the relationship between the ASR performance and degradation factors including both noise and reverberation. In this study, we here propose new noisy and reverberant criteria which are referred as \~ANoisy and Reverberant Speech Recognition with the PESQ and the Dn (NRSR-PDn)\~A. We first designed the \~ANRSR-PDn\~A using the relationships among the D value, the PESQ score, and the ASR performance. We then estimated the ASR performance with the designed criteria \~ANRSR-PDn\~A in evaluation experiments. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that our proposed criteria make the well suited for robustly estimating the ASR performance in noisy and reverberant environments.},

  abstract = {There is normally a simple choice made in the form of the covariance matrix to be used with continuous-density HMMs. Either a diagonal covariance matrix is used, with the underlying assumption that elements of the feature vector are independent, or a full or block-diagonal matrix is used, where all or some of the correlations are explicitly modeled. Unfortunately when using full or block-diagonal covariance matrices there tends to be a dramatic increase in the number of parameters per Gaussian component, limiting the number of components which may be robustly estimated. This paper introduces a new form of covariance matrix which allows a few ``full'' covariance matrices to be shared over many distributions, whilst each distribution maintains its own ``diagonal'' covariance matrix. In contrast to other schemes which have hypothesized a similar form, this technique fits within the standard maximum-likelihood criterion used for training HMMs. The new form of covariance matrix is evaluated on a large-vocabulary speech-recognition task. In initial experiments the performance of the standard system was achieved using approximately half the number of parameters. Moreover, a 10\% reduction in word error rate compared to a standard system can be achieved with less than a 1\% increase in the number of parameters and little increase in recognition time},

  abstract = {The performance of automatic speech recognition based on coded-decoded speech heavily depends on the quality of the transmitted signals, determined by channel impairments. This paper examines relationships between speech recognition performance and measurements of speech quality and intelligibility over transmission channels. Different to previous studies, the effects of super-wideband transmissions are analyzed and compared to those of wideband and narrowband channels. Furthermore, intelligibility scores, gathered by conducting a listening test based on logatomes, are also considered for the prediction of automatic speech recognition results. The modern instrumental measurement techniques POLQA and POLQA-based intelligibility have been respectively applied to estimate the quality and the intelligibility of transmitted speech. Based on our results, polynomial models are proposed that permit the prediction of speech recognition accuracy from the subjective and instrumental measures, involving a number of channel distortions in the three bandwidths. This approach can save the costs of performing automatic speech recognition experiments and can be seen as a first step towards a useful tool for communication channel designers.},

  abstract = {Speech enhancement and separation are core problems in audio signal processing, with commercial applications in devices as diverse as mobile phones, conference call systems, hands-free systems, or hearing aids. In addition, they are crucial preprocessing steps for noise-robust automatic speech and speaker recognition. Many devices now have two to eight microphones. The enhancement and separation capabilities offered by these multichannel interfaces are usually greater than those of single-channel interfaces. Research in speech enhancement and separation has followed two convergent paths, starting with microphone array processing and blind source separation, respectively. These communities are now strongly interrelated and routinely borrow ideas from each other. Yet, a comprehensive overview of the common foundations and the differences between these approaches is lacking at present. In this paper, we propose to fill this gap by analyzing a large number of established and recent techniques according to four transverse axes: 1) the acoustic impulse response model, 2) the spatial filter design criterion, 3) the parameter estimation algorithm, and 4) optional postfiltering. We conclude this overview paper by providing a list of software and data resources and by discussing perspectives and future trends in the field.}

It is shown how the Long-Term Average Speech Spectrum (LTASS) can be used to identify the unknown channel and a blind channel identification algorithm is developed based on that. Furthermore, an established approximate formula for LTASS is demonstrated to be a useful tool in the context. The algorithm is evaluated using a weighted spectral distortion measure using simulated, measured and real channels with various distinct spectral characteristics. It is demonstrated that the algorithm can identify accurately the magnitude spectrum of an unknown channel in noise-free conditions. We also show results for three different additive noises where estimation accuracy is reduced but the degradation varies largely, depending on the long-term spectral characteristics of the noise.},

  abstract = {We present the Bayesian Adaptive Speech Intelligibility Estimation (BASIE) method -- a tool for rapid estimation of a given speech reception threshold (SRT) and the slope at that threshold of multiple psychometric functions for speech intelligibility in noise. The core of this tool is an adaptive Bayesian procedure, which adjusts the signal-to-noise ratio at each subsequent stimulus such that the expected variance of the threshold and slope estimates are minimised. Simulation results show that the algorithm is able to achieve SRT estimates accurate to within {$\pm$}1 dB in under 30 iterations. Furthermore, we discuss strategies for using BASIE to evaluate the effects of speech processing algorithms on intelligibility and we give two illustrative examples for different noise reduction methods with supporting listening experiments.},

The algorithm employs channel robust RASTA filtered Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients as features and a Gaussian mixture model based classifier to generate a dictionary of average speech spectra. These are then used to infer the channel response from speech that has undergone spectral modification in the capturing process. Simulation results using babble noise, car noise and white Gaussian noise are presented, which demonstrate that the proposed method is able to estimate a variety of channel responses to within 3-4 dB in terms of weighted spectral distance; and it is more accurate than a previously published method.},

  abstract = {The reverberation time, T60, is one of the key parameters used to quantify room acoustics. It can provide information about the quality and intelligibility of speech recorded in a reverberant environment, and it can be used to increase robustness to reverberation of speech processing algorithms. T60 can be determined directly from a measurement of the acoustic impulse response, but in situations where this is unavailable it must be estimated blindly from reverberant speech. In this contribution, we provide a study of three state-of-the-art methods for blind T60 estimation. Experimental results with a large number of talkers, simulated and measured acoustic impulse responses, and various levels of additive white Gaussian noise are presented. The relative merits of the three methods in terms of computational time, estimation accuracy, noise sensitivity and intertalker variance are discussed. In general, all three methods are able to estimate the reverberation time to within 0.2 s for T60 {$\dottedsquare$} 0.8 s and SNR {$\dottedsquare$} 30 dB, while increasing the noise level causes overestimation. The relative computational speed of the three methods is also assessed.},

The weights of activated atoms in an observation serve directly as evidence for the underlying event classes. The atoms in the dictionary span multiple frames and are created by extracting all possible fixed-length exemplars from the training data. To combat data scarcity of small training datasets, we propose to artificially augment the amount of training data by linear time warping in the feature domain at multiple rates.

We show that the bias compensation is unnecessary when we replace the VAD by a soft speech presence probability (SPP) with fixed priors. Choosing fixed priors also has the benefit of decoupling the noise power estimator from subsequent steps in a speech enhancement framework, such as the estimation of the speech power and the estimation of the clean speech.We show that the proposed SPP approach maintains the quick noise tracking performance of the bias compensated MMSE-based approach while exhibiting less overestimation of the spectral noise power and an even lower computational complexity.},

  abstract = {Computational methods are considered for finding a point that satisfies the second-order necessary conditions for a general (possibly nonconvex) quadratic program (QP). The first part of the paper considers the formulation and analysis of an active-set method for a generic QP with both equality and inequality constraints. The method uses a search direction that is the solution of an equality-constrained subproblem involving a ``working set'' of linearly independent constraints. The method is a reformulation of a method for general QP first proposed by Fletcher, and modified subsequently by Gould. The reformulation facilitates a simpler analysis and has the benefit that the algorithm reduces to a variant of the simplex method when the QP is a linear program. The search direction is computed from a KKT system formed from the QP Hessian and the gradients of the working-set constraints. It is shown that, under certain circumstances, the solution of this KKT system may be updated using a simple recurrence relation, thereby giving a significant reduction in the number of KKT systems that need to be solved. The second part of the paper focuses on the solution of QP problems with constraints in so-called standard form. We describe how the constituent KKT systems are solved, and discuss how an initial basis is defined. Numerical results are presented for all QPs in the CUTEst test collection.},

  abstract = {Neuronal oscillations are ubiquitous in the brain and may contribute to cognition in several ways: for example, by segregating information and organizing spike timing. Recent data show that delta, theta and gamma oscillations are specifically engaged by the multi-timescale, quasi-rhythmic properties of speech and can track its dynamics. We argue that they are foundational in speech and language processing, `packaging' incoming information into units of the appropriate temporal granularity. Such stimulus-brain alignment arguably results from auditory and motor tuning throughout the evolution of speech and language and constitutes a natural model system allowing auditory research to make a unique contribution to the issue of how neural oscillatory activity affects human cognition.}

An array of six omnidirectional microphones and a corresponding time delay compensation module are used to provide a beamformed signal as input to a HMM-based recognizer. Training of HMMs is performed either using a clean speech database or using a filtered version of the same database. Filtering consists in a convolution with the acoustic impulse response between the speaker and microphone, to reproduce the reverberation effect. Background noise is summed to provide the desired SNR. The paper shows that the new models trained on these data perform better than the baseline ones. Furthermore, the paper investigates on maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR) adaptation of the new models. It is shown that a further performance improvement is obtained, allowing to reach a 98.7\% WRR in a connected digit recognition task, when the talker is at 1.5 m distance from the array},

  abstract = {Abstract Lombard and Clear speech represent two acoustically and perceptually distinct speaking styles that humans employ to increase intelligibility. For Lombard speech, increased spectral energy in a band spanning the range of formants is consistent, effectively augmenting loudness, while vowel space expansion is exhibited in Clear speech, indicating greater articulation. On the other hand, analyses in the first part of this work illustrate that Clear speech does not exhibit significant spectral energy boosting, nor does the Lombard effect invoke an expansion of vowel space. Accordingly, though these two acoustic phenomena are largely attributed with the respective intelligibility gains of the styles, present analyses would suggest that they are mutually exclusive in human speech production. However, these phenomena can be used to inspire signal processing algorithms that seek to exploit and ultimately compound their respective intelligibility gains, as is explored in the second part of this work. While Lombard-inspired spectral shaping has been shown to successfully increase intelligibility, Clear speech-inspired modifications to expand vowel space are rarely explored. With this in mind, the latter part of this work focuses mainly on a novel frequency warping technique that is shown to achieve vowel space expansion. The frequency warping is then incorporated into an established Lombard-inspired Spectral Shaping method that pairs with dynamic range compression to maximize speech audibility (SSDRC). Finally, objective and subjective evaluations are presented in order to assess and compare the intelligibility gains of the different styles and their inspired modifications.},

By knowing the model parameters that were used for compression one is able to recover the original uncompressed signal from a \~Abroadcast\~A signal with high numerical accuracy and very low computational complexity. A compressor-decompressor scheme is worked out and described in detail. The approach is evaluated on real-world audio material with great success.},

  abstract = {Spatial release from masking is traditionally measured with speech in front. The effect of head-orientation with respect to the speech direction has rarely been studied. Speech-reception thresholds (SRTs) were measured for eight head orientations and four spatial configurations. Benefits of head orientation away from the speech source of up to 8\,dB were measured. These correlated with predictions of a model based on better-ear listening and binaural unmasking (r\,=\,0.96). Use of spontaneous head orientations was measured when listeners attended to long speech clips of gradually diminishing speech-to-noise ratio in a sound-deadened room. Speech was presented from the loudspeaker that initially faced the listener and noise from one of four other locations. In an undirected paradigm, listeners spontaneously turned their heads away from the speech in 56\% of trials. When instructed to rotate their heads in the diminishing speech-to-noise ratio, all listeners turned away from the speech and reached head orientations associated with lower SRTs. Head orientation may prove valuable for hearing-impaired listeners.}

  abstract = {Development and evaluation of algorithms for digital signal processing in hearing aids includes many stages from the first implementation of the algorithmic idea, technical evaluations, subjective evaluations with patients up to field tests, and involves several expert groups, usually physicists, engineers, audiologists and hearing aid acousticians. In order to facilitate this complex process, a common platform for development and evaluation is desirable that covers the whole development process and integrates seamlessly the work of the different expert groups. This paper discusses the possibility of using PC-based hardware for this task. Considering the Master-Hearing-Aid (MHA) developed within the H\"orTech center of competence on hearing technology as an example, it is shown that the approach of using standardized hardware and software is most promising. The MHA allows for the integration of algorithm development using standard software like Matlab and algorithm evaluation using low-delay real-time processing in combination with user-friendly graphical control interfaces. Performance tests show that real-time processing on modern PC-based hardware is possible even with algorithms written in the Matlab script language, although in this case processing delay is larger and floating point performance is smaller than in algorithms programmed in the C language. For waveform processing, a total delay of 4.35 ms can be reached at less than 5\% CPU-load when implemented in C, and a delay of about 94 ms at about 20\% CPU-load when implemented as a Matlab script. For spectral FFT-based processing, a total delay of 7.25 ms can be reached at less than 10\% CPU-load when implemented in C, and a delay of about 187 ms at about 30\% CPU-load when implemented as a Matlab script.}

A perception-based simplification algorithm is presented for the selection of the early reflections using a criterion which depends both on the arrival time and on the angle of incidence of the early reflection with respect to the listener. Results of two subjective tests for the evaluation of the proposed algorithm are presented. The proposed algorithm is shown to provide a significant reduction in the number of early reflections without significantly affecting the tested localisational or spatial qualities of auralisation.},

  abstract = {The objective of binaural noise reduction algorithms is not only to selectively extract the desired speaker and to suppress interfering sources (e.g., competing speakers) and ambient background noise, but also to preserve the auditory impression of the complete acoustic scene. For directional sources this can be achieved by preserving the relative transfer function (RTF) which is defined as the ratio of the acoustical transfer functions relating the source and the two ears and corresponds to the binaural cues. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the performance of three algorithms that are based on the binaural minimum variance distortionless response (BMVDR) beamformer, and hence, process the desired source without distortion. The BMVDR beamformer preserves the binaural cues of the desired source but distorts the binaural cues of the interfering source. By adding an interference reduction (IR) constraint, the recently proposed BMVDR-IR beamformer is able to preserve the binaural cues of both the desired source and the interfering source. We further propose a novel algorithm for preserving the binaural cues of both the desired source and the interfering source by adding a constraint preserving the RTF of the interfering source, which will be referred to as the BMVDR-RTF beamformer. We analytically evaluate the performance in terms of binaural signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR), signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the three considered beamformers. It can be shown that the BMVDR-RTF beamformer outperforms the BMVDR-IR beamformer in terms of SINR and outperforms the BMVDR beamformer in terms of SIR. Among all beamformers which are distortionless with respect to the desired source and preserve the binaural cues of the interfering source, the newly proposed BMVDR-RTF beamformer is optimal in terms of SINR. Simulations using acoustic transfer functions measured on a binaural hearing aid validate our theoretical results.}

  abstract = {In addition to interference and noise reduction, an important objective of binaural speech enhancement algorithms is the preservation of the binaural cues of both the target and the undesired sound sources. For directional sources, this can be achieved by preserving the relative transfer function (RTF). The recently proposed binaural minimum variance distortionless response (BMVDR) beamformer preserves the RTF of the target, but typically distorts the RTF of the interfering sources. Recently, two extensions of the BMVDR beamformer were proposed preserving the RTFs of both the target and the interferer, namely, the binaural linearly constrained minimum variance (BLCMV) and the BMVDR-RTF beamformers. In this paper, we generalize the BMVDR-RTF to trade off interference reduction and noise reduction. Three special cases of the proposed beamformer are examined, either maximizing the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR), the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), or the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). Experimental validations in an office environment validate our theoretical results.}

  abstract = {In five subjects, head movement during conversation was monitored by polarised light goniometry, and recorded alongside speech and a signal proportional to peak amplitude of sound waves (`peak loudness'). Kinematic properties of listeners' head movements, such as amplitude, frequency and cyclicity, differentiated various conversational functions. That is, they were function-specific: symmetrical, cyclic movements were employed to signal `yes', `no' or equivalents; linear, wide movements anticipated claims for speaking; narrow linear movements occurred in phase with stressed syllables in the other's speech (`ynchrony' movements); and wide, linear movements occurred during pauses in the other's speech. That, it is argued, bears upon the relation between thesignalling of communicative intentions and the synchronisation of interactional rhythm. Thus, the former appears to determine the timing and tempo of responses such as `yes' and `no', while the latter determines the regulation of `synchrony' movements. The manner in which these factors interact in other conversational functions and their theoretical implications are discussed.},

This tuning enables, for example, that the complexity of the separation system be adjusted in each band if a subband structure is employed for sources separation.},

An augmented intensity vector (AIV) is proposed which improves the accuracy of PIVs by exploiting higher order spherical harmonics. We compared DOA estimation using our proposed AIVs against PIVs, steered response power (SRP) and subspace methods where the number of sources, their angular separation, the reverberation time of the room and the sensor noise level are varied. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline methods and performs at least as accurately as the state-of-theart method with strong robustness to reverberation, sensor noise, and number of sources. In the single and multiple source scenarios tested, which include realistic levels of reverberation and noise, the proposed method had average error of 1.5\textdegree{} and 2\textdegree, respectively.}

  abstract = {The basis of an improved form of iterative speech enhancement for single-channel inputs is sequential maximum a posteriori estimation of the speech waveform and its all-pole parameters, followed by imposition of constraints upon the sequence of speech spectra. The approaches impose intraframe and interframe constraints on the input speech signal. Properties of the line spectral pair representation of speech allow for an efficient and direct procedure for application of many of the constraint requirements. Substantial improvement over the unconstrained method is observed in a variety of domains. Informed listener quality evaluation tests and objective speech quality measures demonstrate the technique's effectiveness for additive white Gaussian noise. A consistent terminating point of the iterative technique is shown. The current systems result in substantially improved speech quality and linear predictive coding (LPC) parameter estimation with only a minor increase in computational requirements. The algorithms are evaluated with respect to improving automatic recognition of speech in the presence of additive noise and shown to outperform other enhancement methods in this application.},

However, dementia and hearing impairment present immense challenges in their own right, and their intersection in the auditory brain remains poorly understood and difficult to assess. Here, we outline a clinically oriented, symptom-based approach to the assessment of hearing in dementias, informed by recent progress in the clinical auditory neuroscience of these diseases. We consider the significance and interpretation of hearing loss and symptoms that point to a disorder of auditory cognition in patients with dementia. We identify key auditory characteristics of some important dementias and conclude with a bedside approach to assessing and managing auditory dysfunction in dementia.},

An increasing problem in this area of work is the contamination of recordings with interference caused by radio transmissions from GSM mobile phones. Transmitting phones emit short duration radio-frequency pulses at a rate of 217 Hz. The induced interference signal contains the 217 Hz fundamental and a large number of harmonics that overlap the frequency range of speech, and therefore severely degrade speech intelligibility. Listener fatigue is increased due to the harsh sound of the interference, and overall the transcription of such audio samples is problematic. This paper describes the progressing development of a filter to assist the forensic phonetician in carrying out the transcription of such contaminated recordings.},

  abstract = {In recent years, high-quality speech recording is requested for comfortably using a communication system. However, a clipping distortion caused by input exceeding the maximum range of amplifier is one of the problems with a sound quality degradation. Although linear prediction method has been conventionally proposed for restoring a clipped speech signal, it has a problem that the frequently clipped speech signal degrades the restoration performance by increasing the prediction errors. In this paper, we propose a method for restoring a clipped speech signal based on a spectral transformation of each frequency band. In this method, the spectral envelope of target speech signal in each frame is approximated to the spectral envelope of original speech signal to remove the influence of a clipping distortion. In particular, the spectral envelope in higher frequency domain including a static characteristic of the speaker is replaced with the spectral envelope of the unclipped speech signal prepared in advance. Then, the spectral envelope in lower frequency domain including a characteristic of phoneme is approximated with Gaussian Mixture Models. We carried out an evaluation experiment for sound quality of speech signal processed by the proposed method. As a result, we confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Although a linear prediction method has been conventionally proposed for suppressing clipping noise, it has a problem with degradation of the restoration performance by cumulating error when the speech includes a large amount of clipping noise. This paper describes a method for suppression of clipping noise in observed speech based on spectral compensation. In this method, the power spectral envelope of speech on each frame in the lower frequency band is noise suppressed to by using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and the one in the higher frequency band is restored by referring to the clean speech. We carried out evaluation experiments with a speech quality, and confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method toward the speech, which includes a large amount of clipping noise.},

Since the noise PSD is unknown in advance, estimation from the noisy speech signal is necessary. An overestimation of the noise PSD will lead to a loss in speech quality, while an underestimation will lead to an unnecessary high level of residual noise. We present a novel approach for noise tracking, which updates the noise PSD for each DFT coefficient in the presence of both speech and noise. This method is based on the eigenvalue decomposition of correlation matrices that are constructed from time series of noisy DFT coefficients. The presented method is very well capable of tracking gradually changing noise types. In comparison to state-of-the-art noise tracking algorithms the proposed method reduces the estimation error between the estimated and the true noise PSD. In combination with an enhancement system the proposed method improves the segmental SNR with several decibels for gradually changing noise types. Listening experiments show that the proposed system is preferred over the state-of-the-art noise tracking algorithm.},

These techniques often have a wide range of parameters which need to be adjusted to obtain optimal processing results. This paper investigates the difficulty of finding the best parameter settings for a commercial noisereduction system. In a first experiment, operators adjusted the settings of a particular system while attempting to maximise the intelligibility of speech corrupted with babble noise at different signal-to-noise ratios. Their preferences were then evaluated in a listening experiment - showing that their chosen settings actually reduced intelligibility compared to the original signal. In another experiment a range of parameter settings for the same system were evaluated using both listeners and an intelligibility model based on a speech envelope distortion measure. Although the measure is imperfect, it is still able to predict optimal parameter settings better than the human operators.},

  abstract = {The effect of noise reduction on the intelligibility of speech in noise is poorly understood. Although the SNR of noisy speech is improved by the removal of more noise than speech from the signal, the expected increase in intelligibility does not typically occur. To account for these deleterious effects we present an orthogonal decomposition of the signal intensity envelopes at the output of a filterbank. The noisy speech envelopes are decomposed into components indicating (1) the coherence of speech across audio bands; (2) the distortion of the speech envelope; and (3) the speechiness of the noise. By modelling the results of a listening experiment we show that envelope distortion can largely account for the deleterious effects of noise reduction; although reduced coherence could also play a role at low SNRs. There was little evidence for the idea that increased speechiness of the noise contributed to the poorer intelligibility after noise reduction},

  abstract = {We present a method for estimating the direct-to-reverberant energy ratio (DRR) that uses a direct and reverberant sound spatial correlation matrix model (Hereafter referred to as the spatial correlation model). This model expresses the spatial correlation matrix of an array input signal as two spatial correlation matrices, one for direct sound and one for reverberation. The direct sound propagates from the direction of the sound source but the reverberation arrives from every direction uniformly. The DRR is calculated from the power spectra of the direct sound and reverberation that are estimated from the spatial correlation matrix of the measured signal using the spatial correlation model. The results of experiment and simulation confirm that the proposed method gives mostly correct DRR estimates unless the sound source is far from the microphone array, in which circumstance the direct sound picked up by the microphone array is very small. The method was also evaluated using various scales in simulated and actual acoustical environments, and its limitations revealed. We estimated the sound source distance using a small microphone array, which is an example of application of the proposed DRR estimation method.},

  abstract = {Research on recovering the sound source waveform from signals observed in a room with reverberation is important for diagnosis of mechanical failure and improvement of clarity in conference calls. In this paper, the possibility is studied for recovery of the original sound waveform from only the reverberation time information without inverse filtering of the transfer function of the reverberant field. The power envelope of the indoor impulse response is approximated with an exponential function and the envelope of the speech signal is restored by power envelope inverse filtering of the reverberant signal. As a result, the modulation index improvement scale using the difference of the modulation indices of the restored signal and the reverberant signal is improved by 60\% in the case of a reverberation time of about 1~s and a modulation frequency of 10~Hz in an experiment using the modulated noise signal in a reverberant field. In the reverberant speech restoration experiment, the distortion of the power envelope can be reduced by about 3 dB when the power envelope distortion rates of the restored speech and the reverberant speech with respect to the original sound are compared. By means of bandwidth separation of the reverberant speech signal, the power envelope distortion of each band can be improved},

  abstract = {A general scheme is presented for predicting speech intelligibility in rooms. This scheme is based on the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF), a physical characteristic which reflects the effect of the room (reverberation, interfering noise) on the modulation index of a (hypothetical) test signal with a variable modulation frequency. The MTF can be converted into a single index, the Speech Transmission Index (STI), which bears a direct relation to speech intelligibility. Following the lines of statistical room acoustics, the STI can be derived mathematically from the following set of (design) specifications: (1) the room's volume, (2) the room's reverberation time, (3) the ambient noise level, (4) the talker's vocal output, and (5) the talker-to-listener distance. The validity of this approach is illustrated by considering several of its predictions in the light of experimental data and empirical rules in auditorium acoustics.},

  abstract = {Human listeners are able to understand speech in the presence of a noisy background. How to simulate this perceptual ability remains a great challenge. This paper describes a preliminary evaluation of intelligibility of the output of a monaural speech segregation system. The system performs speech segregation in two stages. The first stage segregates voiced speech using supervised learning of harmonic features, and the second stage segregates unvoiced speech by subtracting noise energy that is estimated from voiced intervals and onset/offset based segmentation. Objective evaluation in terms of the match to ideal binary time-frequency masks shows substantial improvements. Tests with human subjects indicate that the system improves intelligibility for young listeners when the input SNR is very low, but does not aid elderly listeners. This preliminary evaluation identifies aspects of the system that should be improved in order to produce consistent improvement in intelligibility in noisy environments.}

  abstract = {A lot of effort has been made in computational auditory scene analysis (CASA) to segregate speech from monaural mixtures. The performance of current CASA systems on voiced speech segregation is limited by lacking a robust algorithm for pitch estimation. We propose a tandem algorithm that performs pitch estimation of a target utterance and segregation of voiced portions of target speech jointly and iteratively. This algorithm first obtains a rough estimate of target pitch, and then uses this estimate to segregate target speech using harmonicity and temporal continuity. It then improves both pitch estimation and voiced speech segregation iteratively. Novel methods are proposed for performing segregation with a given pitch estimate and pitch determination with given segregation. Systematic evaluation shows that the tandem algorithm extracts a majority of target speech without including much interference, and it performs substantially better than previous systems for either pitch extraction or voiced speech segregation.},

  abstract = {In this thesis, a novel computational method for the perceptual evaluation of quality differences between audio signals is presented. The core of this method is the computer model of the ``effective'' signal processing in the auditory system by Dau et al. (1997) which is employed to transform the acoustic signals that are to be compared, into corresponding internal representations in the perceptual domain. Chapter 2 shows the capability of the method to predict subjective quality ratings of audio signals which have been processed by different lossy audio coding schemes. In chapter 3, an alternative method for the subjective evaluation of high quality audio coding schemes is proposed, which estimates detection thresholds of audio distortions psychoacoustically. The simulation of the performed psychoacoustic experiments by the auditory model of Dau et al. yields high correlation with the measured data. Finally, chapter 4 investigates how the perceived quality of noise reduction schemes for speech can be predicted by means of the method presented in chapter 2. To complete the picture optimized variants of the prediction method are included in the study as well as different subjective quality criteria to be predicted by these methods.},

  abstract = {In moderate levels of noise, listeners report that noise reduction (NR) processing can improve the perceived quality of a speech signal as measured on a typical MOS rating scale. Most quantitative experiments of intelligibility, however, show that NR reduces the intelligibility of noisy speech signals, and so should be expected to increase the cognitive effort required to process utterances. To study cognitive effort we look at how NR affects reaction times to speech in noise, using material that is still highly intelligible. We show that adding noise increases reaction times and that NR does not restore reaction times back to the quiet condition. The implication is that NR does not make speech ``easier'' to process, at least as far as this task is concerned.},

In this paper we consider how such processing affects listener productivity in everyday speech communication. Two measures are presented: one based on reaction time to spoken digits, and one based on finding errors in a transcript of a spoken conversation. We explain why such tasks are a useful complement to measures based on intelligibility, then present the methodology and results for two evaluations of these measures using MMSE processing on speech corrupted by babble and car-noise. Finally we discuss the implications for the use of NR techniques and for our understanding of how signal quality affects speech communication.},

We propose that new performance-based evaluation methods are required which tap into the cognitive effort listeners employ to understand speech through such systems. We present an example of such a method, based on the correction of transcripts of fluent spontaneous dialogues, and evaluate it for six different signal qualities, including telephone, added noise and noise-reduced conditions. We show that signal quality has a significant effect both in terms of transcript error detection accuracy and in terms of processing speed. We also show that in this test noise-reduction did not have any beneficial effect, despite the commonly recorded opinion that noise reduction improves signal quality.},

Based on the analysis of an existing RT estimation method, which models the reverberation decay as a Gaussian random process modulated by a deterministic envelope, a Laplacian distribution based decay model is proposed in which an efficient procedure for locating free decay from reverberant speech is also incorporated. Then the RT is estimated from the free decays by the ML estimator. The method was motivated by our observation that the distribution pattern for temporal decay of the reverberant hand clap is much closer to the Laplace distribution. The estimation accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated using the experimental results and is in good agreement with the RT values measured from room impulse responses.},

The only restrictions are that the positions of the unknown samples should be known and that they should be embedded in a sufficiently large neighborhood of known samples. The estimates of the unknown samples are obtained by minimizing the sum of squares of the residual errors that involve estimates of the autoregressive parameters. A statistical analysis shows that, for a burst of lost samples, the expected quadratic interpolation error per sample converges to the signal variance when the burst length tends to infinity. The method is in fact the first step of an iterative algorithm, in which in each iteration step the current estimates of the missing samples are used to compute the new estimates. Furthermore, the feasibility of implementation in hardware for real-time use is established. The method has been tested on artificially generated auto-regressive processes as well as on digitized music and speech signals.},

  abstract = {This book presents the signal processing algorithms that have been developed to process the signals acquired by a spherical microphone array. Spherical microphone arrays can be used to capture the sound field in three dimensions and have received significant interest from researchers and audio engineers. Algorithms for spherical array processing are different to corresponding algorithms already known in the literature of linear and planar arrays because the spherical geometry can be exploited to great beneficial effect.  The authors aim to advance the field of spherical array processing by helping those new to the field to study it efficiently and from a single source, as well as by offering a way for more experienced researchers and engineers to consolidate their understanding, adding either or both of breadth and depth. The level of the presentation corresponds to graduate studies at MSc and PhD level. This book begins with a presentation of some of the essential mathematical and physical theory relevant to spherical microphone arrays, and of an acoustic impulse response simulation method, which can be used to comprehensively evaluate spherical array processing algorithms in reverberant environments. The chapter on acoustic parameter estimation describes the way in which useful descriptions of acoustic scenes can be parameterized, and the signal processing algorithms that can be used to estimate the parameter values using spherical microphone arrays. Subsequent chapters exploit these parameters including in particular measures of direction-of-arrival and of diffuseness of a sound field.  The array processing algorithms are then classified into two main classes, each described in a separate chapter. These are signal-dependent and signal-independent beamforming algorithms. Although signal-dependent beamforming algorithms are in theory able to provide better performance compared to the signal-independent algorithms, they are currently rarely used in practice. The main reason for this is that the statistical information required by these algorithms is difficult to estimate. In a subsequent chapter it is shown how the estimated acoustic parameters can be used in the design of signal-dependent beamforming algorithms. This final step closes, at least in part, the gap between theory and practice.},

For the purpose of estimating room acoustics, it is very essential to calculate the reverberation time more accurately. The study shows that Direct-to-Reverberation Ratio can also be calculated in accordance to the estimation of Reverberation Time. These two parameters can be made useful in the application of hearing aid.},

  abstract = {Intelligibility listening tests are necessary during development and evaluation of speech processing algorithms, despite the fact that they are expensive and time consuming. In this paper, we propose a monaural intelligibility prediction algorithm, which has the potential of replacing some of these listening tests. The proposed algorithm shows similarities to the short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) algorithm, but works for a larger range of input signals. In contrast to STOI, extended STOI (ESTOI) does not assume mutual independence between frequency bands. ESTOI also incorporates spectral correlation by comparing complete 400ms length spectrograms of the noisy/processed speech and the clean speech signals. As a consequence, ESTOI is also able to accurately predict the intelligibility of speech contaminated by temporally highly modulated noise sources in addition to noisy signals processed with time-frequency weighting. We show that ESTOI can be interpreted in terms of an orthogonal decomposition of short-time spectrograms into intelligibility subspaces, i.e., a ranking of spectrogram features according to their importance to intelligibility. A free MATLAB implementation of the algorithm is available for noncommercial use at http://kom.aau.dk/~jje/.},

This algorithm estimates the linear prediction residuals of the clean speech using a constrained optimization criterion. The signal distortion is minimized in the residual domain subject to a constraint on the average power of the noise residuals. Enhanced speech is obtained by exciting the time-varying all-pole synthesis filter with the estimated residuals of the clean speech. The proposed method was tested with speech corrupted by both white Gaussian and colored noise. The enhancement performances were evaluated in terms of segmental signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and ITU-PESQ scores. Experimental results indicate our method yields better enhancement results than a former residual-weighting scheme [Yegnanarayana, B., Avendano, C., Hermansky, H., Murthy P.S., 1999. Speech enhancement using linear prediction residual. Speech Commun. 28, 25--42].

The problem is formulated as a blind deconvolution problem with non-negative constraints, regularized by the sparse nature of speech spectrograms. We derive an iterative algorithm for its optimization, which can be seen as a special case of the non-negative matrix factor deconvolution. We confirmed through experiments that the algorithm is fast and robust to speaker movement.},

  abstract = {We present observations of ground accelerations recorded at a small array close to the fault during the D\"uzce earthquake and its early aftershocks. The records show the strong spatial variability of ground acceleration over distances of only a few hundred metres. During the main shock, the peak horizontal acceleration values ranged from 0.3 to about 1.0 g at stations distant of 1.5 km only. We attribute this spatial variability to a fault zone site effect as peak ground acceleration steadily increases as the distance to the fault trace decreases. The spectral ratio between the ground motion recorded near the fault and the one outside the fault zone shows a shift of the spectral peak to lower frequencies with increasing peak accelerations. Such an observation suggests a non-linear behaviour of the fault zone due to the strong ground shaking. As much as a 45 per cent reduction in the shear wave velocity is necessary for the observed shifts. The opening of pre-existing cracks throughout the fault zone is the proposed mechanism to account for the observed shear wave reductions. The observation that elastic fault zone properties are soon recovered following episodes of large strains shows that cracks and fissures close rapidly after the strong shaking is over.},

  abstract = {Peak clipping is a common form of distortion in hearing aids and can reduce the subjective quality of the amplified speech. In a previous study involving listeners with normal hearing (Kates  Kozma-Spytek, 1994), the effect of peak clipping on speech quality ratings was studied using sentence test materials that were filtered using three different frequency response contours and then clipped at four different clipping levels. The present study extends the quality ratings to include those from a group of listeners having moderate to profound hearing impairments. The experimental results indicate that the clipping level, and the interaction of the frequency-response shaping with the clipping level, significantly affects speech quality. It is also shown that the distortion effects on speech quality for the listeners with impaired hearing can be modeled by a distortion index computed from the magnitude-squared coherence of the speech-processing system in response to a shaped-noise input signal. The distortion-index weights derived for the group of listeners with impaired hearing, however, differ substantially from those derived for listeners with normal hearing, and substantial inter-listener variation was also observed.},

The impulse responses (IRs) were measured with three-channel behind-the-ear (BTEs) hearing aids and an in-ear microphone at both ears of a human head and torso simulator. The database aims at providing a tool for the evaluation of multichannel hearing aid algorithms in hearing aid research. In addition to the HRIRs derived from measurements in an anechoic chamber, sets of BRIRs for multiple, realistic head and sound-source positions in four natural environments reflecting daily-life communication situations with different reverberation times are provided. For comparison, analytically derived IRs for a rigid acoustic sphere were computed at the multichannel microphone positions of the BTEs and differences to real HRIRs were examined. The scenes' natural acoustic background was also recorded in each of the real-world environments for all eight channels. Overall, the present database allows for a realistic construction of simulated sound fields for hearing instrument research and, consequently, for a realistic evaluation of hearing instrument algorithms.},

  abstract = {Adaptive filtering in the DFT domain is popular for its computational efficiency and its attractive convergence properties resulting from the applicability of the FFT and separate adaptation of individual DFT bins. Narrowband algorithms assume a complete decoupling of different frequency bins, which corresponds to assuming a circulant structure for the input data matrix. Wideband designs account for the difference between the actual T\"oplitz structure and the circulant structure by introducing additional constraints. In this contribution, we show that a wideband approach with rigorous implementation of appropriate constraints leads to highly efficient algorithms with excellent convergence properties. As examples we consider multichannel acoustic echo cancellation (MC-AEC) and blind source separation (BSS) of convolutive mixtures.}

It overcomes drawbacks found in applying music signals directly to the envelope spectrum detector developed for the estimation of RT from speech signals. The octave band music signal is first separated into sub bands corresponding to notes on the equal temperament scale and the level of each note normalised before applying an envelope spectrum detector. A typical artificial neural network is then trained to map these envelope spectra onto RT or EDT. Significant improvements in estimation accuracy were found and further investigations confirmed that the non-stationary nature of music envelopes is a major technical challenge hindering accurate parameter extraction from music and the proposed method to some extent circumvents the difficulty},

Measurements are usually made while these spaces are unoccupied for logistical reasons. However, occupancy can have a significant impact on the rate of reverberant decay. Recent work has developed a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method which utilises only passively recorded speech and music signals, this enables measurements to be made while the room is in use. In this paper the MLE method is applied to recordings made in classrooms during lessons. Classroom occupancy levels differ for each lesson, therefore a model is developed using blind estimates to predict the RT for any occupancy level to within {$\pm$}0.07 s for the mid-frequency octave bands. The model is also able to predict the effective room and per person absorption area. Ambient sound recordings were also carried out in a number of rooms in two hospitals for a week. Hospital measurements are more challenging as the occurrence of free reverberant decay is rarer than in schools and the acoustic conditions may be non-stationary. However, by gaining recordings over a period of a week, estimates can be gained within pm0.07 s. These estimates are representative of the times when the room contains the highest acoustic absorption. In other words when curtains are drawn, there are many visitors or perhaps a window may be open.},

  abstract = {Normal listeners possess the remarkable perceptual ability to select a single speech stream among many competing talkers. However, few studies of selective attention have addressed the unique nature of speech as a temporally extended and complex auditory object. We hypothesized that sustained selective attention to speech in a multitalker environment would act as gain control on the early auditory cortical representations of speech. Using high-density electroencephalography and a template-matching analysis method, we found selective gain to the continuous speech content of an attended talker, greatest at a frequency of 4\textendash 8 Hz, in auditory cortex. In addition, the difference in alpha power (8\textendash 12 Hz) at parietal sites across hemispheres indicated the direction of auditory attention to speech, as has been previously found in visual tasks. The strength of this hemispheric alpha lateralization, in turn, predicted an individualtextquoterights attentional gain of the cortical speech signal. These results support a model of spatial speech stream segregation, mediated by a supramodal attention mechanism, enabling selection of the attended representation in auditory cortex.}

The input speech is passed through a low order linear predictive coding (LPC) filter to obtain the LP residual signal. It is proven that the unbiased autocorrelation function of this LP residual has the required properties to be used as an input to the ML estimator. It is shown that this method can successfully estimate the reverberation time with less data than existing blind methods. Experiments show that the proposed method can produce better estimates of RT60, even in highly reverberant rooms. This is because the entire input speech data is used in the estimation process. The proposed method is not sensitive to the type of input data (voiced, unvoiced), number of gaps, or window length. In addition, evaluation using white Gaussian noise and recorded babble noise shows that it can estimate RT60 in the presence of (moderate) background noise.},

  abstract = {Recently, a lot of attention has been paid to regularization based methods for sparse signal reconstruction (e.g., basis pursuit denoising and compressed sensing) and feature selection (e.g., the Lasso algorithm) in signal processing, statistics, and related fields. These problems can be cast as -regularized least-squares programs (LSPs), which can be reformulated as convex quadratic programs, and then solved by several standard methods such as interior-point methods, at least for small and medium size problems. In this paper, we describe a specialized interior-point method for solving large-scale -regularized LSPs that uses the preconditioned conjugate gradients algorithm to compute the search direction. The interior-point method can solve large sparse problems, with a million variables and observations, in a few tens of minutes on a PC. It can efficiently solve large dense problems, that arise in sparse signal recovery with orthogonal transforms, by exploiting fast algorithms for these transforms. The method is illustrated on a magnetic resonance imaging data set.},

The ultimate goal of this study is to classify speech sound data regardless of their size using EEG; however, as an initial stage of the study, we classified only two different speech syllables using Gaussian hidden markov model. The result of this study shows a possibility that EEG could be used for hearing screening and other diagnostic tools related to speech perception.},

In such case, there is a tremendous loss of information, and traditional methods fail to appropriately recover the signal.

This approach, which enforces the consistency of the reconstructed signal with the clipped observations, shows superior performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art declipping algorithms. This is confirmed on synthetic and on actual high-dimensional audio data processing, both on SNR and on subjective user listening evaluations.},

  abstract = {Binaural hearing aids use microphone inputs from both the left and right hearing aid to generate an output for each ear. On the other hand, a monaural hearing aid generates an output by processing only its own microphone inputs. This correspondence presents a binaural extension of a monaural multichannel noise reduction algorithm for hearing aids based on Wiener filtering. In addition to significantly suppressing the noise interference, the algorithm preserves the interaural time delay (ITD) cues of the speech component, thus allowing the user to correctly localize the speech source. Unfortunately, binaural multichannel Wiener filtering distorts the ITD cues of the noise source. By adding a parameter to the cost function the amount of noise reduction performed by the algorithm can be controlled, and traded off for the preservation of the noise ITD cues},

A comparative assessment of the reviewed algorithms is undertaken, the algorithm advantages and disadvantages are indicated, insight to the algorithms is offered, and deductions as well as recommendations are given. Rich transcription and movie analysis are candidate applications that benefit from combined speaker segmentation and clustering.},

For an unknown source, we propose to apply sparse blind system identification (BSI) methods to identify the acoustic impulse responses, from which the TDOAs of temporally sparse reflections are estimated. The proposed time- and frequency-domain adaptive algorithms based on crossrelation formulation are regularized by incorpo- rating an L1-norm sparseness constraint, which is realized using a split Bregman method. These algorithms are shown to outperform standard crossrelation-based BSI techniques when estimating TDOAs of reflections in the presence of background noise.},

  abstract = {Peak clipping is a common form of distortion in hearing aids and can reduce the subjective quality of the amplified speech. In a previous study involving listeners with normal hearing (Kates  Kozma-Spytek, 1994), the effect of peak clipping on speech quality ratings was studied using sentence test materials that were filtered using three different frequency response contours and then clipped at four different clipping levels. The present study extends the quality ratings to include those from a group of listeners having moderate to profound hearing impairments. The experimental results indicate that the clipping level, and the interaction of the frequency-response shaping with the clipping level, significantly affects speech quality. It is also shown that the distortion effects on speech quality for the listeners with impaired hearing can be modeled by a distortion index computed from the magnitude-squared coherence of the speech-processing system in response to a shaped-noise input signal. The distortion-index weights derived for the group of listeners with impaired hearing, however, differ substantially from those derived for listeners with normal hearing, and substantial inter-listener variation was also observed.},

The proposed algorithm uses joint maximum likelihood estimation of the speech and late reverberation spectral variances, under the assumption that the late reverberant sound field is cylindrically isotropic. The dereverberation performance of the algorithm is evaluated using computer simulations with realistic hearing aid microphone signals including head-related effects. The algorithm is shown to work well with signals reverberated both by synthetic and by measured room impulse responses, achieving improvements in the order of 0.5 PESQ points and 5 dB frequency-weighted segmental SNR.}

Both of them are based on the multi-channel Wiener filter but they use different estimators of the speech and reverberation power spectral densities (PSDs). We first derive closedform expressions for the mean square error (MSE) of both PSD estimators and then show that one estimator - previously used for speech dereverberation by the authors - always yields a better MSE. Only in the case of a two microphone array or for special spatial distributions of the interference both estimators yield the same MSE. The theoretically derived MSE values are in good agreement with numerical simulation results and with instrumental speech quality measures in a realistic speech dereverberation task for binaural hearing aids.}

The PSD estimation method proposed in this paper is based on the maximum likelihood (ML) methodology. In particular, we derive a novel ML PSD estimation scheme that is suitable for sound scenes which besides speech and reverberation consists of an additional noise component whose second-order statistics are known. The proposed algorithm is shown to outperform an existing similar algorithm in terms of PSD estimation accuracy. Moreover, it is shown numerically that the mean-squared estimation error achieved by the proposed method is near the limit set by the corresponding Cram\'er-Rao lower bound. The speech dereverberation performance of a multichannel Wiener filter based on the proposed PSD estimators is measured using several instrumental measures and is shown to be higher than when the competing estimator is used. Moreover, we perform a speech intelligibility test where we demonstrate that both the proposed and the competing PSD estimators lead to similar intelligibility improvements.}

It outlines the theory and practice of sound behaviour in enclosed spaces. Particular emphasis is given to the properties and calculation of reverberation, the most obvious acoustical feature of a closed room. Further key topics include the mechanisms of sound absorption and psychoacoustical factors, from which design parameters and figures of merit are derived. Two chapters are devoted to practical questions such as measurement techniques and the procedures of room acoustical design. The interaction between a room\&apos;s acoustic properties and its electroacoustic systems is also considered, and refined systems for optimizing listening conditions in a room are presented. This edition includes a new list of symbols, and updated sections include the measurement of the impulse response including a discussion of distortions, sound propagation as a diffusive process and scattering by wall irregularities.},

The algorithm is robust against different types of clipping and is efficient compared to existing approaches. The algorithm has been implemented in an open source JavaScript client-side web application. Clipping detection is shown to give an f-measure of 0.92 and is robust to the clipping level.},

  abstract = {The equivalent source method can be used to model acoustic scattering, by representing the scattering object with a set of equivalent sources that satisfy a boundary condition. The equivalent source strengths are optimised by a least-squares method. When the equivalent sources are positioned further from the boundary to reduce the boundary condition error, the optimisation becomes ill-conditioned. This limits the application of the equivalent source method in irregularly-shaped objects as boundary condition error is highly sensitive to equivalent source placement. To overcome the problem of ill-conditioning, a regularisation parameter is introduced, which increases the robustness to errors in the modelled acoustic field by limiting the power of overdriven equivalent sources. Simulations of a rigid infinite wall with an equivalent dipole line-array, reveal that regularisation reduces boundary condition error in all ill-conditioned cases. Good trade-offs between boundary condition error and regularisation are achieved for a wide range of regularisation parameter values. This allows the results to be calculated for varying frequencies and distances between the equivalent sources and the boundary. Regularisation reduces the sensitivity of boundary condition error to equivalent source placement, thereby increasing the flexibility of the equivalent source method for irregularly-shaped scattering objects}

Two methods based on FFT-overlap-adding and onlinear prediction, respectively, have been developed. Linear envelope filtering was not successful for neither pre- nor postprocessing, even though the objective NRwas improved. However, inserting a logarithmic nonlinearity or, better, a logarithmic one becoming linear at high levels, did raise intelligibility in the presence of noise when the filter effected strong compression at very low and no change or expansion at higher modulation frequencies. Since noise masking can serve as a model for recruitment in sensorineural hearing impairment, the method might be used in future hearing aids.},

The problem of reverberation suppression differs from classical speech de-noising in that the 'reverberation noise' is non stationary. In this paper, the use of a novel estimator of the non-stationary reverberation noise power spectrum, based on a statistical model of late reverberation, is presented. The algorithm is tested on real reverberated signals. The performances for different RIRs with T\textsubscript{t}au ranging from 0.34 s to 1.7 s consistently show significant noise reduction with little signal distortion. Moreover, when used as a front end to an automatic speech recognition system, the algorithm brings about dramatic improvements in terms of automatic speech recognition scores in various reverberant environments.},

Such material may contain high levels of noises, and we seek to devise features that will reveal music content in such circumstances. Sustained, steady musical pitches show significant, structured autocorrelation at when calculated over windows of hundreds of milliseconds, where autocorrelation of aperiodic noise has become negligible at higher-lag points if a signal is whitened by LPC. Using such features, further compensated by their long-term average to remove the effect of stationary periodic noise, we produce GMM and SVM based classifiers with high performance compared with previous approaches, as verified on a corpus of real consumer video.},

A geometrical analysis of the image-source principle leads to a closed-form expression describing the energy decay curve, with the resulting formula being valid for a uniform as well as non-uniform definition of the enclosure's six absorption coefficients. The accuracy of the proposed approximation is demonstrated on the basis of impulse-response simulations involving various room sizes and reverberation levels, with uniform and non-uniform sound absorption coefficients. An application example for the proposed method is illustrated by considering the task of predicting an enclosure's reflection coefficients in order to achieve a specific reverberation level. The technique presented in this work enables designers to undertake a preliminary analysis of a simulated reverberant environment without the need for time-consuming image-method simulations.},

This is a challenging problem that cannot be solved without analysing the temporal evolution of the signal. Current state-of-the-art methods combine timbral with temporal characteristics, by summarising various feature values over time, e.g. by computing their variance. This leads to more contextual information, but also to increased latency, which is problematic if our goal is on-line, real-time singing voice detection. To overcome this problem and reduce the necessity to include context in the features themselves, we introduce a method that uses Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNN). In experiments on several data sets, the resulting singing voice detector outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, while at the same time drastically reducing latency and increasing the time resolution of the detector.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a post-filtering estimation scheme for multichannel noise reduction. The proposed method is an extension and improvement of the existing Zelinski and McCowan post-filters which use the auto- and cross-spectral densities of the multichannel input signals to estimate the transfer function of the Wiener post-filter. A drawback in previous two post-filters is that the noise power spectrum at the beamformer's output is over-estimated and therefore the derived filters are sub-optimal in the Wiener sense. The proposed method overcomes this problem and can be used for the construction of an optimal post-filter which is also appropriate for a variety of different noise fields. In experiments with real noise multichannel recordings the proposed technique has shown to obtain a significant gain over the other studied methods in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, log area ratio distance and speech degradation measure. In particular the proposed post-filter presents a relative SNR enhancement of 17.3\% and a relative decrease on signal degradation of 21.7\% compared to the best of all the other studied methods.}

It is useful in many applications including acoustic scene analysis, robust automatic speech recognition and dereverberation. Given knowledge of the acoustic impulse response, reverberation time can be measured using Schroeder's backward integration method. Since it is not always practical to obtain impulse responses, blind estimation algorithms are sometimes desirable. In this work, the reverberation problem is viewed as an image blurring problem. The blur kernel is estimated through spectral analysis in the modulation domain and the T60 is subsequently estimated from the blur kernel's parameters. It is shown through experimental results that the proposed approach is able to improve robustness to higher T60s especially with increasing levels of additive noise up to an signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10 dB.},

  abstract = {Reverberation time, or T60, is a key parameter used for characterizing acoustic spaces. Blind T60 estimation is useful for many applications including speech intelligibility estimation, acoustic scene analysis and dereverberation. In our previous work, a single-channel blind T60 estimator was proposed employing spectral analysis in the modulation frequency domain. It was shown that the estimation accuracy is crucially affected by the window lengths used for transformation to the modulation domain. In this work, we propose the use of a sliding window length that is dynamically updated depending on the length of the detected decay region. Experimental results demonstrated that in the presence of noise, estimation accuracy was improved over our previous work for T60 up to 700 ms. When compared against two alternative algorithms from the literature, the proposed approach demonstrated higher accuracy for T60 between 500 ms and 1 s. Finally, the proposed approach was shown to be more computationally efficient compared to two of the three alternative algorithms.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a two-microphone technique for localization of multiple sound sources. Its fundamental structure is adopted from a binaural signal-processing scheme employed in biological systems for the localization of sources using interaural time differences (ITD). The two input signals are transformed to the frequency domain and analyzed for coincidences along left/right-channel delay-line pairs. The coincidence information is enhanced by a nonlinear operation followed by a temporal integration. The azimuths of the sound sources are estimated by integrating the coincidence locations across the broadband of frequencies in speech signals (the "direct" method). Further improvement is achieved by using a novel "stencil" filter pattern recognition procedure. This includes coincidences due to phase delays of greater than 2, which are generally regarded as ambiguous information. It is demonstrated that the stencil method can greatly enhance localization of lateral sources over the direct method. Also discussed and analyzed are two limitations involved in both methods, namely missed and artifactual sound sources. Anechoic chamber tests as well as computer simulation experiments showed that the signal-processing system generally worked well in detecting the spatial azimuths of four or six simultaneously competing sound sources.},

The development was based on some independent, hypothesized theories of the computational mechanics of biological systems in which directional hearing is enabled mainly by binaural processing of interaural directional cues. Our system uses two microphones as input devices and a signal processing method based on the two input channels. The signal processing procedure comprises two major stages: (i) source localization, and (ii) cancellation of noise sources based on knowledge of the locations of all sound sources. The source localization, detailed in our previous paper [Liu et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 108, 1888 (2000)], was based on a well-recognized biological architecture comprising a dual delay-line and a coincidence detection mechanism. This paper focuses on description of the noise cancellation stage. We designed a simple subtraction method which, when strategically employed over the dual delay-line structure in the broadband manner, can effectively cancel multiple interfering sound sources and consequently enhance the desired signal. We obtained an 8-10 dB enhancement for the desired speech in the situations of four talkers in the anechoic acoustic test (or 7-10 dB enhancement in the situations of six talkers in the computer simulation) when all the sounds were equally intense and temporally aligned.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper presents a practical technique for Automatic speech recognition (ASR) in multiple reverberant environment selection. Multiple \{ASR\} models are trained with artificial synthetic room impulse responses (IRs), i.e. simulated room IRs, with different reverberation time ( T 60 Model s) and tested on real room \{IRs\} with varying T 60 Room s. To apply our method, the biggest challenge is to choose a proper artificial room \{IR\} model for training \{ASR\} models. In this paper, a generalised statistical \{IR\} model with attenuated reverberation after an early reflection period, named attenuated \{IR\} model, has been adopted based on three time-domain statistical \{IR\} models. Its optimal values of the reverberation-attenuation factor and the early reflection period on the recognition rate have been searched and determined. Extensive testing has been performed over four real room \{IR\} sets (63 \{IRs\} in total) with variant T 60 Room s and speaker microphone distances (SMDs). The optimised attenuated \{IR\} model had the best performance in terms of recognition rate over others. Specific considerations of the practical use of the method have been taken into account including: (i) the maximal training step of T 60 Model in order to get the minimal number of models with acceptable performance; (ii) the impact of selection errors on the \{ASR\} caused by the estimation error of T 60 Room ; and (iii) the performance over \{SMD\} and direct-to-reverberation energy Ratio (DRR). It is shown that recognition rates of over 80 to 90\% are achieved in most cases. One important advantage of the method is that T 60 Room can be estimated either from reverberant sound directly (Takeda et al., 2009; Falk and Chan, 2010; Lollmann et al., 2010) or from an \{IR\} measured from any point of the room as it remains constant in the same room (Kuttruff, 2000), thus it is particularly suited to mobile applications. Compared to many classical dereverberation methods, the proposed method is more suited to \{ASR\} tasks in multiple reverberant environments, such as human-robot interaction.},

We present adaptive enhancement systems based on an existing non-adaptive technique [Ephraim, Y., 19992a. IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing 40 (4), 725--735]. This approach models the speech and noise statistics using autoregressive hidden Markov models (AR-HMMs). We develop two main extensions. The first estimates the noise statistics from detected pauses. The second forms maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the unknown noise parameters using the whole utterance. Both techniques operate within the AR-HMM framework. We have previously shown that the ability of AR-HMMs to model speech can be improved by the incorporation of perceptual frequency using the bilinear transform. We incorporate this improvement into our enhancement systems. We evaluate our techniques on the NOISEX-92 and Resource Management (RM) databases, giving indications of performance on simple and more complex tasks, respectively. Both enhancement schemes proposed are able to improve substantially on baseline results. The technique of forming ML estimates of the noise parameters is found to be the most effective. Its performance is evaluated over a wide range of noise conditions ranging from ?6 to 18 dB and on various types of stationary real-world noises.},

Updated and expanded, this second edition of the bestselling textbook broadens its scope to include evaluation measures and enhancement algorithms aimed at improving speech intelligibility. Fundamentals, Algorithms, Evaluation, and Future Steps Organized into four parts, the book begins with a review of the fundamentals needed to understand and design better speech enhancement algorithms. The second part describes all the major enhancement algorithms and, because these require an estimate of the noise spectrum, also covers noise estimation algorithms. The third part of the book looks at the measures used to assess the performance, in terms of speech quality and intelligibility, of speech enhancement methods. It also evaluates and compares several of the algorithms. The fourth part presents binary mask algorithms for improving speech intelligibility under ideal conditions. In addition, it suggests steps that can be taken to realize the full potential of these algorithms under realistic conditions.},

In this contribution, a new method is devised, which allows to estimate the RT from noisy observations. It is based on a maximum likelihood (ML) estimation which is derived from a statistical model of the sound decay in reverberant and noisy enclosures. This allows to determine the RT from a measured sound decay (or room impulse response) in the presence of noise. It is also shown, how the ML estimator can be used to determine the RT blindly from a noisy and reverberant speech signal.

  abstract = {An improved algorithm for the estimation of the reverberation time (RT) from reverberant speech signals is presented. This blind estimation of the RT is based on a simple statistical model for the sound decay such that the RT can be estimated by means of a maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator. The proposed algorithm has a significantly lower computational complexity than previous ML-based algorithms for RT estimation. This is achieved by a downsampling operation and a simple pre-selection of possible sound decays. The new algorithm is more suitable to track time-varying RTs than related approaches. In addition, it can also estimate the RT in the presence of (moderate) background noise. The proposed algorithm can be employed to measure the RT of rooms from sound recordings without using a dedicated measurement setup. Another possible application is its use within speech dereverberation systems for hands-free devices or digital hearing aids.},

The blind estimation of the fullband reverberation time (RT) by maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation based on [15] is considered as baseline approach. An improvement of this algorithm is presented where an energy-weighted averaging of the upper subband RT estimates is performed using either a DCT or 1/3-octave filter-bank. The evaluation results show that this approach leads to a lower variance for the estimation error in comparison to the baseline approach at the price of an increased computational complexity. Moreover, a new algorithm to estimate the subband RT is devised, where the RT estimates for the lower octave subbands are extrapolated from the RT estimates of the upper subbands by means of a simple model for the frequency-dependency of the subband RT. The evaluation results of the ACE challenge reveal that this approach allows to estimate the subband RT with an estimation error which is in a similar range as for the presented fullband RT estimators.},

  abstract = {The reverberation time is a key feature for describing the acoustic properties of a reverberant room. It can be computed from a measured Room Impulse Response but in many applications it has to be estimated blindly. Existing blind methods give accurate estimates but they often exhibit high variance across different speakers. In this paper, a low variance blind estimator of the reverberation time is derived from the decay rate distribution of the signal. The influence of the reverberation time on the statistical moments of the distribution is analyzed and one relevant moment is taken as an estimator. The variance of the estimator is reduced thanks to a prewhitening filter and a modification of the decay rate distribution. Experimental results confirm the accuracy of the method when the observed signal is sufficiently long. Index Terms: Reverberation time, blind estimation, decay rate distribution, low variance},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of real-time speaker segmentation and speaker tracking in audio content analysis in which no prior knowledge of the number of speakers and the identities of speakers is available. Speaker segmentation is to detect the speaker change boundaries in a speech stream. It is performed by a two-step algorithm, which includes potential change detection and refinement. Speaker tracking is then performed based on the results of speaker segmentation by identifying the speaker of each segment. In our approach, incremental speaker model updating and segmental clustering is proposed, which makes the unsupervised speaker segmentation and tracking feasible in real-time processing. A Bayesian fusion method is also proposed to fuse multiple audio features to obtain a more reliable result, and different noise levels are utilized to compensate for background mismatch. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm can recall 89\% of speaker change boundaries with 15\% false alarms, and 76\% of speakers can be unsupervised identified with 20\% false alarms. Compared with previous works, the algorithm also has low computation complexity and can perform in 15\% of real time with a very limited delay in analysis.},

  abstract = {One of the principal cues believed to be used by listeners to estimate the distance to a sound source is the ratio of energies along the direct and indirect paths to the receiver. In essence, this `direct-to-reverberant' energy ratio reveals the absolute distance component of the direct energy by normalizing by what is assumed to be distance-independent reverberant energy. Earlier approaches to direct-to-reverberant energy ratio calculation made use of the estimated room impulse response, but these techniques are computationally expensive and inaccurate in practice. This paper proposes and evaluates an alternative approach which uses binaural signals to segregate energy arriving from the estimated direction of the direct source from that arriving from other directions, employing a novel binaural equalization-cancellation technique. The system is integrated with a probabilistic inference framework, particle filtering, to handle the nonstationarity of energy-based measurements. The algorithm is capable of using reverberation to estimate source distance in large rooms with errors of less than 1 m for static sources and 1.5-3.5 m for sources with varying degrees of motion complexity. Model performance can be accounted for largely in terms of a competition between auditory horizon and source energy fluctuation effects.},

The acoustical properties of the room have been determined by reverberation time in octave bands and echograms. The mean absorption factor, the reverberation radius and the Modulation Transfer Function are calculated from the reverberation time T. Predicted intelligibility scores are compared to measured values. The great number of late reflections around 2 kHz accounts for a masking of weak consonants by the second formant of previous vowels. These effects have been studied in running speech and in test words within a carrier phrase by means of various analysis technics such as spectrograms, oscillograms, computer analysis with a filter bank, and long time average spectra. Studies of speech envelope functions and their degradations open a way for further investigations. Finally, envelope spectra of speech are studied both in anechoic and in reverberant environments. The speech envelope spectrum from the anechoic chamber shows a flat response up to a modulation frequency of 4 Hz. Above this frequency the slope is -7 d~/oct. In the reverberant room the slope of the envelope spectrum starts at a lower frequency and reaches as a floor after decreasing about 20 dB due to room reflections.},

Although many single-unit and neuroimaging studies have yielded valuable insights about the processing of speech and matched complex sounds, the mechanisms underlying the analysis of speech dynamics in human auditory cortex remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the phase pattern of theta band (4,\"A\`i8 Hz) responses recorded from human auditory cortex with magnetoencephalography (MEG) reliably tracks and discriminates spoken sentences and that this discrimination ability is correlated with speech intelligibility. The findings suggest that an ,\`a\textordmasculine 200 ms temporal window (period of theta oscillation) segments the incoming speech signal, resetting and sliding to track speech dynamics. This hypothesized mechanism for cortical speech analysis is based on the stimulus-induced modulation of inherent cortical rhythms and provides further evidence implicating the syllable as a computational primitive for the representation of spoken language.},

  abstract = {Acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) and de-reverberation technologies are increasingly important to improve the voice communication and control performance in challenging acoustic environments. In both voice over IP teleconferencing and voice command control, AEC is needed to remove the far-end speech or the playback audio from the speakers and allow the near-end speech to enter the command control system or the far-end listener. Even there is no far-end speech, the near-end speech, i.e. captured signal can be degraded by reverberation when a speaker is far away from the microphone. This reverberation interference significantly degrades speech quality and speech recognition accuracy. A spectral subtraction based approach has been used for reverberation reduction in our system. In this paper, we propose to estimate the reverberation time based on the estimated room impulse response from the multidelay acoustic echo canceller. The approach is able to effectively reduce reverberation in noisy environments while maintaining low complexity on system level.},

The interference to signal processing which results from reverberation can be extensive, and is particularly acute when the boundaries (surface, bottom) of the water column are nearby. Of particular interest are situations where there may be weak targets masked by reverberation dominating the returning signal. The reverberation is represented as the output of a linear system with the transmitted signal as an input. The random nature of the reverberation is accounted for by using random parameters in the linear model, the most important of which are those parameters impacting the spatial distribution of the reverberation. Time delay estimation is used to analyze reverberant signals obtained from a sonar system operating in a shallow water environment. The statistics of the linear models obtained from these analyses are computed and discussed},

  abstract = {In the book Mathematics of Data Fusion as well as in earlier papers and the recent monograph An Introduction to Multisource-Multitarget Statistics and Its Applications, I have proposed a unified Bayesian approach to multisource-multitarget fusion, detection, tracking, and identification based on a multitarget generalization of the Bayesian recursive nonlinear filtering equations. The foundation for this approach is finite-set statistics, a systematic generalization of standard engineer's statistical calculus to the multisensor-multitarget realm. I showed, in particular, how true multitarget likelihood functions can be constructed using this calculus. In this paper I show that true multitarget Markov motion models can be constructed in much the same manner. If such an approach is to ever become practical, however, computationally tractable approximate filters will have to be devised. This paper elaborates an approach suggested in Mathematics of Data Fusion: para-Gaussian densities-i.e., multitarget analogs of Gaussian distributions that result in closed-form integrations when inserted into the multitarget Bayesian recursive nonlinear equations. I propose an approximate multitarget filter based on the para-Gaussian concept that shows some promise of leading to computational tractibility.},

  abstract = {The Minimum Statistics noise power spectral density (PSD) estimation approach is based on tracking minima of a short term power spectral density (PSD) estimate in frequency subbands. Since the short term minimum power is always smaller than (or in trivial cases equal to) the mean power, the minimum noise power estimate is a biased estimate of the mean power. For an accurate noise power estimate this bias must be compensated.In this paper we review bias compensation methods for moving average and first-order recursive smoothed psd estimates. While for some cases exact expressions for the bias are available, approximations are required in general. We present approximations which allow an efficient computation and compensation of the bias. We discuss factors that influence the bias and show that the method is to some extent robust to variations of the signal statistics. Besides different smoothing methods, we discuss the effect of overlapping spectral analysis windows and of signal correlation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Online hearing tests conducted in home settings on a personal computer (PC) require prior calibration. Biological calibration consists of approximating the reference sound level via the hearing threshold of a person with normal hearing. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify the error of the proposed methods of biological calibration, their duration, and the subjective difficulty in conducting these tests via PC. METHODS: Seven methods have been proposed for measuring the calibration coefficients. All measurements were performed in reference to the hearing threshold of a normal-hearing person. Three methods were proposed for determining the reference sound level on the basis of these calibration coefficients. Methods were compared for the estimated error, duration, and difficulty of the calibration. Web-based self-assessed measurements of the calibration coefficients were carried out in 3 series: (1) at a otolaryngology clinic, (2) at the participant's home, and (3) again at the clinic. Additionally, in series 1 and 3, pure-tone audiometry was conducted and series 3 was followed by an offline questionnaire concerning the difficulty of the calibration. Participants were recruited offline from coworkers of the Department and Clinic of Otolaryngology, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland. RESULTS: All 25 participants, aged 22-35 years (median 27) completed all tests and filled in the questionnaire. The smallest standard deviation of the calibration coefficient in the test-retest measurement was obtained at the level of 3.87 dB (95\% CI 3.52-4.29) for the modulated signal presented in accordance with the rules of Bekesy's audiometry. The method is characterized by moderate duration time and a relatively simple procedure. The simplest and shortest method was the method of self-adjustment of the sound volume to the barely audible level. In the test-retest measurement, the deviation of this method equaled 4.97 dB (95\% CI 4.53-5.51). Among methods determining the reference sound level, the levels determined independently for each frequency revealed the smallest error. The estimated standard deviations of the difference in the hearing threshold between the examination conducted on a biologically calibrated PC and pure-tone audiometry varied from 7.27 dB (95\% CI 6.71-7.93) to 10.38 dB (95\% CI 9.11-12.03), depending on the calibration method. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, an analysis of biological calibration was performed and the presented results included calibration error, calibration time, and calibration difficulty. These values determine potential applications of Web-based hearing tests conducted in home settings and are decisive factors when selecting the calibration method. If there are no substantial time limitations, it is advisable to use Bekesy method and determine the reference sound level independently at each frequency because this approach is characterized by the lowest error.},

For this special case the noise power estimator tends to underestimate the noise power. We identify the variance estimator in the Minimum Statistics approach of being the origin of the observed underestimation. The variance estimator controls the bias compensation which is necessary to infer the mean power from a minimum value. This estimator turns out to be biased when the data is correlated. We provide an expression that describes the bias and show that by exploiting this the noise power estimation can be improved.},

We are focussing on their estimation features in a non-stationary noisy environment while a speech signal is present, as this is one of the unsolved problems for spectral subtraction algorithms. All one-channel solutions make use of the different statistics of speech and unwanted noise. The two-channel algorithms use the spatial characteristics of the noise field in order to estimate the power spectral densities (PSD). First we will briefly describe existing algorithms, then we will introduce a new one, which is related to the one proposed by Gierl. Furthermore, we will introduce different error-criteria to compare the algorithm's capabilities to follow the actual noise-spectrum.},

  abstract = {A single-channel blind dereverberation algorithm is proposed in this letter for distant-talking speech recognition. The proposed method is based on spectral subtraction (SS) method, in which the spectrum of a late reverberant signal is estimated using a delayed and attenuated version of the reverberant signal. Through some assumptions, the conventional SS method regards the attenuation weight as a constant that is a function of reverberation time. However, these assumptions are not valid in real situations, and the ideal weight varies with the frame. Therefore, in the proposed method, the variable weight sequence is estimated using Viterbi decoding scheme based on the reverberation model. This weight sequence is then substituted for the fixed weight in the conventional SS method without explicitly estimating the reverberation time. The proposed method performs better than the conventional SS method in both isolated word recognition and connected digit recognition experiments in reverberant environments.},

  abstract = {The phoneme identification process of an automatic speech recognition system may be aided through the use of statistics of phoneme occurrence in conversational English. These statistics are also applicable to the fields of linguistics and speech, to teaching English as a foreign language and to speech pathology. In this study a data base containing 103887 phoneme occurrences taken from casual conversational American English was obtained through interviews of sixteen adult males and ten adult females. The speech was transcribed using a quasi-phonemic system, known as ARPAbet, plus selected phoneme alternates and was analysed with computer assistance to obtain the rank order of phonemes according to frequency of occurrence. Also, the radius of the confidence interval for the observed frequency of occurrence was calculated at the 95\% level for each phoneme. The top ten phonemes (in order, / a, n, t, i, s, r, i, l, d, ? /) account for 47\% of all the data. As expected, the results of the present study correlate highly with those of one other major study of natural speech. Comparisons show some interesting differences in detail, however, that appear to be attributable to relatively minor variations in the experimental procedures.},

To identify the source position, until some ambiguities, a single acoustic impulse response is required. To overcome these ambiguities, two additional impulse responses are needed. The three impulse responses can be obtained in the same time or by sequential measurements, two at a time. Experimental results obtained by real measurements which prove the theoretical ideas are presented.},

It employs multichannel linear prediction to obtain a reverberant residual signal and subsequent larynx-synchronous temporal averaging to attenuate the reverberation during voiced speech. Experimental results suggest the method is successful but, to date, no detailed analysis of the theoretical basis of the larynx-synchronous averaging has been undertaken. In this paper the SMERSH algorithm is reviewed before focussing on the theoretical basis of its approach. We show that the amount of dereverberation that can be achieved depends on the coherence of reverberation between frames. Simulations show that the extent of dereverberation increases with reverberation time and give an insight into the tradeoff between dereverberation and speech distortion.},

The system uses a reference beamformer whose look direction is informed by knowledge of the head orientation and the a priori known direction of the desired source. From this a time-frequency mask is estimated using a deep neural network. The binaural signals are obtained using bilateral beamformers followed by a classical minimum mean square error speech enhancer, modified to use the estimated mask as a speech presence probability prior. In simulated experiments, the improvement in a binaural intelligibility metric (DBSTOI) given by the proposed system relative to beamforming alone corresponds to an SNR improvement of 4 to 6 dB. Results also demonstrate the individual contributions of incorporating the mask and the head orientation-aware beam steering to the proposed system.}

  abstract = {The noise covariance matrix computed between the signals from a microphone array is used in the design of spatial filters and beamformers with applications in noise suppression and dereverberation. This paper specifically addresses the problem of estimating the covariance matrix associated with a noise field when the array is rotating during desired source activity, as is common in head-mounted arrays. We propose a parametric model that leads to an analytical expression for the microphone signal covariance as a function of the array orientation and array manifold. An algorithm for estimating the model parameters during noise-only segments is proposed and the performance shown to be improved, rather than degraded, by array rotation. The stored model parameters can then be used to update the covariance matrix to account for the effects of any array rotation that occurs when the desired source is active. The proposed method is evaluated in terms of the Frobenius norm of the error in the estimated covariance matrix and of the noise reduction performance of a minimum variance distortionless response beamformer. In simulation experiments the proposed method achieves 18 dB lower error in the estimated noise covariance matrix than a conventional recursive averaging approach and results in noise reduction which is within 0.05 dB of an oracle beamformer using the ground truth noise covariance matrix.},

These instants correspond to the instants of glottal closure for voiced speech. The method uses the properties of the global phase characteristics of minimum phase signals. Robustness of the method against noise and distortion is due to the fact that the average phase characteristics of a signal is determined mainly by the strength of the excitation impulse. The strength of excitation is determined by the energy of the residual error signal around the instant of excitation. We propose a measure for the strength of the excitation based on Frobenius norm of the differenced signal. The robustness of the group-delay-based method is illustrated for speech under different types of degradations and for speech from different speakers},

  abstract = {We present a system for robust signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimation based on computational auditory scene analysis (CASA). The proposed algorithm uses an estimate of the ideal binary mask to segregate a time-frequency representation of the noisy signal into speech dominated and noise dominated regions. Energy within each of these regions is summated to derive the filtered global SNR. An SNR transform is introduced to convert the estimated filtered SNR to the true broadband SNR of the noisy signal. The algorithm is further extended to estimate subband SNRs. Evaluations are done using the TIMIT speech corpus and the NOISEX92 noise database. Results indicate that both global and subband SNR estimates are superior to those of existing methods, especially at low SNR conditions.},

  abstract = {Speech recordings obtained in the context of law enforcement are often degraded in terms of quality and intelligibility. Several techniques for assessing the impact of speech enhancement algorithms on quality are available, both intrusive and nonintrusive, but the assessment of intelligibility is usually reliant on expensive and time consuming subjective listening scores. To address this issue, we describe some recent scoring experiments and an adaptive Bayesian procedure which efficiently estimates properties of the psychometric function from a small number of listening tests. A data-driven nonintrusive objective intelligibility estimation method is also described and tested on car and babble noise. It is shown to give intelligibility estimates that are well correlated with subjective scores. We aim to improve our understanding of the quality/intelligibility tradeoff and to study speech processing tools in the critical context of law enforcement.},

  abstract = {Acoustic signal processing research has been addressing the issues associated with additive noise and other degradations in speech for many years and several significant technical advances are now embedded in the state-of-the-art. Nevertheless, the problems are not solved and may actually be worsening. The philosophy advocated in this paper is that further improvements in acoustic signal processing for noise reduction and robustness are, of course, important but are unlikely to be sufficient on their own. Alongside the signal processing, successful systems are likely going to need to include two further factors: an element of matching to the human perception system and also an element of sensing and adaptation to the local environment, giving systems acoustic awareness. Examples of current research on human perception and acoustic signal processing are discussed. These include some aspects of auditory cognition and signal processing methods for building acoustic awareness. A new initiative for benchmarking is also highlighted.},

  abstract = {To assess the impact of interventions designed to reduce residential space heating demand, investigators must be armed with field-trial applicable techniques that accurately measure space heating energy use. This study assesses the feasibility of using a single-point acoustic sensor to detect gas consumption events in domestic combination gas-fired boilers (C-GFBs). The investigation has shown, for the C-GFB investigated, the following events are discernible using a single-point acoustic sensor: demand type (hot water or central heating); boiler ignition; fan runtime and motor frequency; and pump runtime and motor frequency. A detection algorithm was developed to automatically identify demand type and burner ignition from sounds made by the C-GFB with accuracies of 100\% and 97\% respectfully. Demand type was determined by training a naive Bayes classifier. Burner ignition was determined by detecting a low frequency (5 -10 Hz) pressure pulse produced during ignition. The acoustic signatures of the fan and pump were identified manually along with their respective motor frequencies. Additional work is required to detect burner duration, deal with detection in the presence of increased noise and expand the range of boilers investigated. There are considerable implications resulting from the widespread use of such a device on improving understanding of space heating demand.},

The objective of this paper is to present data which characterize the longtime speech amplitude density utilizing a data base of sufficient size to describe the distribution. The data base consists of approximately 45 min of recorded speech for each of the 25 speakers. Two parameters of a theoretical gamma density function are estimated from the experimental data to provide the best curve fit between the experimental data and the gamma density function. Overall results presented in this paper substantiate three main conclusions: There is a significant difference between the speech amplitude density for male and female speakers; the speech amplitude density for positive speech amplitudes differs from that for negative speech amplitudes; and the gamma probability density function is a better approximation for full-wave rectified speech than it is when considering just positive or just negative amplitudes},

  abstract = {A technique is described for the determination of the first three formant frequencies of a voiced speech signal corrupted by high levels of noise. The technique involves a rough frequency-domain analysis followed by an accurate time-domain statistical analysis. The frequency-domain analysis is performed with a bank of overlapped, shifted, bandpass digital filters chosen to cover the frequency range of the first three formant frequencies. The time-domain analysis involves a calculation of the consistency of the intervals between successive zero-crossings at the output of each filter. As the algorithm proceeds, those filters which contain peaks in the energy spectrum are chosen as a first estimate of the location of the first three formants. The final choice of filter containing each formant is made, in the neighborhood of the first estimate, by choosing that filter with a signal output having the maximum zero-crossing interval consistency. A decision procedure is applied to several calculated parameters to result in a measurement of each of the first three formant frequencies. The results of extensive testing of the method are reported for speech contaminated by high levels of additive white Gaussian noise.},

In almost all noise reduction systems an estimate of the current noise power spectral density (PSD) is required. As common methods for background noise estimation fail due to the non-stationary characteristics of wind noise signals, special algorithms are required. The proposed estimation technique consists of three steps: a feature extraction followed by a wind noise detection and the calculation of the current wind noise PSD. For all steps we exploit the different spectral energy distributions of speech and wind noise. In this context, the so-called signal centroids are introduced. Investigations with measured audio data show that our method can cope with the non-stationary characteristics and enables a sufficient reduction of wind noise. In contrast to other wind noise reduction schemes the proposed algorithm has low complexity and low memory consumption.},

The characteristic that wind noise signals are sparse in time and frequency is exploited in a way that only time-frequency regions that are determined as degraded are enhanced. In these regions of the noisy signal, a process is applied to reconstruct the clean speech data. This is realized by a separation of the noisy speech signal into an autoregressive filter representing the human vocal tract and its excitation signal. The clean filter coefficients of the former are estimated using a pre-trained codebook. A pitch cycle taken from clean speech is adapted to reconstruct the excitation of noisy speech segments.},

  abstract = {A multi-channel noise reduction technique is presented based on a Speech Distortion-Weighted Multi-channel Wiener Filter (SDW-MWF) approach that incorporates the conditional Speech Presence Probability (SPP). A traditional SDW-MWF uses a fixed parameter to a trade-off between noise reduction and speech distortion without taking speech presence into account. Consequently, the improvement in noise reduction comes at the cost of a higher speech distortion since the speech dominant segments and the noise dominant segments are weighted equally. Incorporating the conditional SPP in SDW-MWF allows to exploit the fact that speech may not be present at all frequencies and at all times, while the noise can indeed be continuously present. In speech dominant segments it is then desirable to have less noise reduction to avoid speech distortion, while in noise dominant segments it is desirable to have as much noise reduction as possible. Experimental results with hearing aid scenarios demonstrate that the proposed SDW-MWF incorporating the conditional SPP improves the signal-to-noise ratio compared to a traditional SDW-MWF.},

  abstract = {Across the spectrum of known algorithm for position estimation there is no favorite method. Some algorithms require intensive computation capabilities, while other algorithms could be implemented in devices with limited resources such as sensor nodes. In this paper an approach for solving nonlinear problems on the example of multilateration is presented in both cases with and without over determination. Thereby neither approximation, nor iterative solutions are used. In the proposed method, the nonlinear elements of the equations system are treated as additional unknowns, which represent simultaneously a constraint. Thus a new equations system is created, which is solved by mean of linear algebra methods with low computational complexity. The algorithm was implemented and tested in conjunction with a developed UWB indoor positioning system.

The clipping is performed on the baseband OFDM signals with and without oversampling, followed by the ideal low-pass filter. First, the effect of the envelope clipping on the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and the instantaneous power of the band-limited OFDM signal is studied. We then discuss the channel capacity of the oversampled and clipped OFDM signals over the additive white Gaussian noise and ideally interleaved Rayleigh fading channels. The capacity is calculated based on the assumption that the distortion terms caused by the clipping are Gaussian. It is shown that the SNR penalty due to the clipping can be considerably alleviated by using optimal coding and reducing the information data rate. The results are justified by the simulation results using near optimal turbo codes},

The developments in the theory, since the introduction of these models, are also given. These include: the effects of shadowing; multiple scattering effects; integral equation techniques and variational methods. Results from experimental investigations of rough surface scattering are also reviewed. These results are compared with the theoretical predictions. A brief review is also given of the methods by which the profiles of rough surfaces are measured and the problems inherent in making these measurements. A comparison is made between the assumed profiles, used in the theory, and the measured profiles.}

It is shown that various equilibrium shapes can be easily found by solving a forced-deformation analysis problem formulated as a minimization problem considering the nodal coordinates as design variables. The objective function is defined in terms of the member lengths, and it can be regarded as the total strain energy corresponding to fictitious elastic material properties. The self-equilibrium forces can be found from the optimality conditions of the nonlinear programming problem. Stability of the self-equilibrium shape is investigated based on the local convexity of the objective function. Similarity between form-finding problem of a structure with zero-unstressed-length cables and the problem of minimum square-length network is also discussed. Furthermore, folding of a structure with small unstressed-length cables is approximately simulated using affine transformation of equilibrium shape.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to develop the Polish sentence matrix test (PSMT) to measure intelligibility of speech presented against a background noise. The PSMT consists of five columns containing: 10 names, 10 verbs, 10 numerals, 10 adjectives, and 10 nouns. Since each word was available as a separate sound file, it was possible to generate different sentences by juxtaposing randomly selected words taken from respective columns. This approach allows 100 000 unique sentences of a fixed grammatical structure to be generated. The speech reception threshold (SRT), i.e. the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) providing 50\% speech intelligibility and S50, the slope of an intelligibility function at the SRT point, were shown to be -9.6 dB and 17.1 \%/dB, respectively. Note that in this study dB is regarded as dB SNR, otherwise reference is given. PSMT was also evaluated using an adaptive 1-up/ 1-down staircase procedure in investigations with and without participation of an experimenter. No significant differences were shown for SRTs obtained in these investigations.}

  abstract = {In this work, a multiple sound source localization and counting method is presented, that imposes relaxed sparsity constraints on the source signals. A uniform circular microphone array is used to overcome the ambiguities of linear arrays, however the underlying concepts (sparse component analysis and matching pursuit-based operation on the histogram of estimates) are appli- cable to any microphone array topology. Our method is based on detecting time-frequency (TF) zones where one source is dominant over the others. Using appropriately selected TF components in these `single-source'\~A\^A zones, the proposed method jointly estimates the number of active sources and their corresponding directions of arrival (DOAs) by applying a matching pursuit-based approach to the histogram of DOA estimates. The method is shown to have excellent performance for DOA estimation and source counting, and to be highly suitable for real-time applications due to its low complexity. Through simulations (in various signal-to-noise ratio conditions and reverberant environments) and real environment experiments, we indicate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art DOA and source counting methods in terms of accuracy, while being significantly more efficient in terms of computational complexity.},

  abstract = {A key feature of speech is the quasi-regular rhythmic information contained in its slow amplitude modulations. In this article we review the information conveyed by speech rhythm, and the role of ongoing brain oscillations in listeners' processing of this content. Our starting point is the fact that speech is inherently temporal, and that rhythmic information conveyed by the amplitude envelope contains important markers for place and manner of articulation, segmental information, and speech rate. Behavioral studies demonstrate that amplitude envelope information is relied upon by listeners and plays a key role in speech intelligibility. Extending behavioral findings, data from neuroimaging \textendash{} particularly electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) \textendash{} point to phase locking by ongoing cortical oscillations to low-frequency information (\textasciitilde 4\textendash 8\,Hz) in the speech envelope. This phase modulation effectively encodes a prediction of when important events (such as stressed syllables) are likely to occur, and acts to increase sensitivity to these relevant acoustic cues. We suggest a framework through which such neural entrainment to speech rhythm can explain effects of speech rate on word and segment perception (i.e., that the perception of phonemes and words in connected speech is influenced by preceding speech rate). Neuroanatomically, acoustic amplitude modulations are processed largely bilaterally in auditory cortex, with intelligible speech resulting in differential recruitment of left-hemisphere regions. Notable among these is lateral anterior temporal cortex, which we propose functions in a domain-general fashion to support ongoing memory and integration of meaningful input. Together, the reviewed evidence suggests that low-frequency oscillations in the acoustic speech signal form the foundation of a rhythmic hierarchy supporting spoken language, mirrored by phase-locked oscillations in the human brain.}

However, they have generally been led on speakers of only one language, and have focused on a single acoustic parameter. The present study is an acoustic analysis of dissyllabic words or pseudo-words produced by 10 Northeastern American English speakers (5 females, 5 males) and 10 Parisian French speakers (5 females, 5 males). Several prosodic parameters were measured: mean f0, f0 range, phonation type (through H1-H2 intensity differences) and words' duration. Significant cross-gender differences were obtained for each tested parameter. Moreover, cross-language variations were observed for f0 range, and H1-H2 differences. These results suggest that cross-gender acoustic differences are partly language-dependent and could be socially constructed.},

If clipping is detected, the clip detection circuit sends a signal to a microprocessor. The microprocessor then sends a signal to a volume control integrated circuit to decrease the voltage level of the audio output until clipping is no longer detected. The amount of attenuation that the microprocessor instructs the volume control integrated circuit to perform is determined by a predetermined programmed parameter. The amount of attenuation to be performed by the volume control integrated circuit can be adjusted by sending the microprocessor a formatted message, through a multiplex bus, corresponding to the predetermined program parameter located in a look-up table.},

Various texture parameters, adopted by ISO standards or not, are described and their distinctive power is considered. Arithmetic parameters, statistical and random process functions serve as measures for rendering in-height and inlength surface characteristics and allow multiparameter analysis of the surface, something quite necessary under current high requirements for precision and operation. Theoretical models for roughness parameters and experimental trends with regard to machining conditions are discussed. Isotropy of machined surfaces is also considered and methods for surface typology are finally discussed.},

Our classification system is a fusion of the two approaches. It is divided in two classifications (speech/non-speech and music/non-music) and provides 94 \% of accuracy for speech detection and 90 \% for music detection, with one second of input signal. Beside the spectral information and GMM, classically used in speech / music discrimination, simple parameters bring complementary and efficient information.},

  abstract = {The asymmetric sampling in time (AST)  hypothesis developed here provides a framework for understanding a range of psychophysical and neuropsychological data on speech perception in the context of a revised cortical functional anatomic model. The \{AST\} model is motivated by observations from psychophysics and cognitive neuroscience that speak to the fractionation of auditory processing, in general, and speech perception, in particular. Building on the observations (1) that the speech signal contains more than one time scale relevant to auditory cognition (e.g. time scales commensurate with processing formant transitions versus scales commensurate with syllabicity and intonation contours), and (2) that speech perception is mediated by both left and right auditory cortices, \{AST\} suggests a time-based perspective that maintains anatomic symmetry while permitting functional asymmetry. \{AST\} proposes that the input speech signal has a neural representation that is bilaterally symmetric at an early representational level. Beyond the initial representation, however, the signal is elaborated asymmetrically in the time domain: left auditory areas preferentially extract information from short (\textasciitilde 20-40 ms) temporal integration windows. The right hemisphere homologues preferentially extract information from long (\textasciitilde 150-250 ms) integration windows. It is suggested that temporal integration is reflected as oscillatory neuronal activity in different frequency bands (gamma, theta).},

Yet it reduces to the analysis of one ball moving at constant velocity along a straight trajectory that experiences specular reflections on the billiard boundaries. Hence, the analogy between billiard trajectories and sound rays. This analogy makes it possible to derive ergodic properties for sound rays. Among these, the concept of mixing singles itself out as the key to a proper understanding of diffusion. Furthermore combining billiard theory with energy conservation allows one to estimate the average number of rays reaching a microphone at any time, thus casting some light on the role of hidden image sources. Billiard theory also casts some new light on the reverberation process; this is illustrated by means of a simple stochastical computer model.},

Multichannel encoding filters are required to implement a discrete spherical harmonic transform and extrapolate the captured sound field coefficients from the array radius to the far field. These spherical harmonic encoding filters can be designed based on a theoretical array model or on measured array responses. Various methods for both design approaches are presented and compared, and differences between modeled and measurement-based filters are investigated. Furthermore, a flexible filter design approach is presented that combines the benefits of previous methods and is suitable for deriving both modeled and measurement-based filters.}

  abstract = {This paper investigates real-time N-dimensional wideband sound source localization in outdoor (far-field) and low-degree reverberation cases, using a simple N-microphone arrangement. Outdoor sound source localization in different climates needs highly sensitive and high-performance microphones, which are very expensive. Reduction of the microphone count is our goal. Time delay estimation (TDE)-based methods are common for N-dimensional wideband sound source localization in outdoor cases using at least N\,+\,1 microphones. These methods need numerical analysis to solve closed-form non-linear equations leading to large computational overheads and a good initial guess to avoid local minima. Combined TDE and intensity level difference or interaural level difference (ILD) methods can reduce microphone counts to two for indoor two-dimensional cases. However, ILD-based methods need only one dominant source for accurate localization. Also, using a linear array, two mirror points are produced simultaneously (half-plane localization). We apply this method to outdoor cases and propose a novel approach for N-dimensional entire-space outdoor far-field and low reverberation localization of a dominant wideband sound source using TDE, ILD, and head-related transfer function (HRTF) simultaneously and only N microphones. Our proposed TDE-ILD-HRTF method tries to solve the mentioned problems using source counting, noise reduction using spectral subtraction, and HRTF. A special reflector is designed to avoid mirror points and source counting used to make sure that only one dominant source is active in the localization area. The simple microphone arrangement used leads to linearization of the non-linear closed-form equations as well as no need for initial guess. Experimental results indicate that our implemented method features less than 0.2 degree error for angle of arrival and less than 10\% error for three-dimensional location finding as well as less than 150-ms processing time for localization of a typical wideband sound source such as a flying object (helicopter).}

Analysis is restricted to the free-decaying regions of the signal, where the reverberation effect dominates, yielding a more accurate RT estimate at a reduced computational cost. A spectral decomposition is performed on the reverberant signal and partial RT estimates are determined in all signal subbands, providing more data to the statistical-analysis stage of the algorithm, which yields the final RT estimate. Algorithm performance is assessed using two distinct speech databases, achieving 91\% and 97\% correlation with the RTs measured by a standard nonblind method, indicating that the proposed method blindly estimates the RT in a reliable and consistent manner.},

Both methods are referred to as blind algorithms in the sense that they are entirely based on the reverberant signal itself, not depending on the knowledge of the clean original signal. Proposed schemes use subband analysis to generate more and more reliable information, which is post-processed using basic statistical analysis to provide the desired estimate for each particular feature. Modifications on the original estimation algorithms are introduced to cope with lower SNRs. Performance of both algorithms is assessed under the ACE Challenge scope, which included a set of 288 speech signals for training and 4500 signals for final test. Results indicate the effectiveness of both techniques particularly in high-SNR situations.},

Design: The development of the test included the selection, recording, optimization with level adjustment, and evaluation of speech material. The training effect was assessed adaptively during the evaluation measurements with six lists of 20 sentences, using open- and closed-set response formats. Reference data were established for normal-hearing listeners with adaptive measurements. Equivalence of the test lists was investigated using the open-set response format at three signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Study sample: A total of 55 normal-hearing Italian mother-tongue listeners. Results: The evaluation measurements at fixed SNRs resulted in a mean speech reception threshold (SRT) of  7.3  0.2 dB SNR and slope of 13.3  1.2 %/dB. The major training effect of 1.5 dB was observed for the first two consecutive measurements. Mean SRTs of  6.7  0.7 dB SNR and  7.4  0.7 dB SNR were found from the third to the sixth adaptive measurement for open- and closed-set test response formats, respectively. Conclusions: A good agreement has been found between the SRTs and slope and those of other matrix tests. Since sentences are difficult to memorize, the Italian matrix test is suitable for repeated  measurements.}

VoIP quality can be degraded by network layer problems (delay, jitter, packet loss). This paper presents a method for real-time, non-intrusive speech quality estimation for VoIP that emulates the subjective listening quality measures based on Mean Opinion Scores (MOS). MOS provide the numerical indication of perceived quality of speech. We employ a Genetic Programming based symbolic regression approach to derive a speech quality estimation model. Our results compare favorably with the International Telecommunications Union-Telecommunication Standardization (ITU-T) PESQ algorithm which is the most widely accepted standard for speech quality estimation. Moreover, our model is suitable for real-time speech quality estimation of VoIP while PESQ is not. The performance of the proposed model was also compared to the new ITU-T recommendation P.563 for non-intrusive speech quality estimation and an improved performance was observed.},

  abstract = {The reverberation time RT is an important parameter for characterizing the quality of an auditory space. Sounds in reverberant environments are subject to coloration. This affects speech intelligibility and sound localization. Many state-of-the-art audio signal processing algorithms, for example in hearing-aids and telephony, are expected to have the ability to characterize the listening environment, and turn on an appropriate processing strategy accordingly. Thus, a method for characterization of room RT based on passively received microphone signals represents an important enabling technology. Current RT estimators, such as Schroeder's method, depend on a controlled sound source, and thus cannot produce an online, blind RT estimate. Here, a method for estimating RT without prior knowledge of sound sources or room geometry is presented. The diffusive tail of reverberation was modeled as an exponentially damped Gaussian white noise process. The time-constant of the decay, which provided a measure of the RT, was estimated using a maximum-likelihood procedure. The estimates were obtained continuously, and an order-statistics filter was used to extract the most likely RT from the accumulated estimates. The procedure was illustrated for connected speech. Results obtained for simulated and real room data are in good agreement with the real RT values.},

In a previous work, a method for the blind maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) of RT using passively received microphone signals was presented. The procedure overcomes the drawbacks of current methods that use a controlled sound source for RT determination. Here, fast algorithms for online implementation of the method are developed. One algorithm, suitable for a one-time determination of the RT, requires O(N) computations for a data frame of length N. A second IIR algorithm, based on Q-levels of quantization, requires O(Q) computations. Results for speech data and choice of algorithms are discussed.},

This estimator has similar benefits to the well-known decision-directed approach, but does not require an ad-hoc weighting factor to balance the past a priori SNR and current ML SNR estimate with smoothing across frames. Performance is evaluated in terms of estimation error and segmental SNR using the standard logSTSA speech enhancement method. Experimental results show that, in contrast with the decision-directed estimator and ML estimator, the proposed SNR estimator can help enhancement algorithms preserve more weak speech information and efficiently suppress musical noise.},

The following headings are used: Conversation statistics. The participants emit speech in relatively short utterances, averaging about 1 sec in duration, and alternate talking and listening roles some 15 times per minute. Volume distribution. The mean power of speech signals on a telephone circuit is characteristic of the person talking under the particular conditions that apply; the mean power while the talker is active, expressed in decibels, is termed 'volume'. Short-term mean power. Speech is generated in the vocal organs by a modulation process, and the resulting sound-pressure waveforms can be treated as having a slowly varying (predominantly six cycles per second) 'modulation' component, impressed on a much higher frequency (2000-8000 c/s) 'carrier' component. Mean power averaged over the duration of a short syllable (say 20 ms) has, for a given talker while active, a distribution that can be approximated by a mathematical expression. Instantaneous voltage distribution. The distribution of instantaneous voltage of speech at a given volume can be approximated by a suitable mathematical expression, which depends upon the characteristics of the microphone involved.},

These HRTFs are usually either measured or simulated with a discrete angular resolution. Using this data directly has several drawbacks, mainly due to the necessary interpolation between these discrete sampling points as well as simplifications in the distance dependence of the near-field HRTF. This paper describes how spherical harmonics (SH) can be used to process HRTF data with the use in real-time capable auralization environments. During the generation of the SH coefficients, the optimal transformation center point is used to achieve a compact transformation. Several strategies are introduced to achieve fast filter reconstruction suitable for real-time auralization.}

A new model has therefore been developed for use across a wider range of network conditions, including analogue connections, codecs, packet loss and variable delay. Known as perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), it is the result of integration of the perceptual analysis measurement system (PAMS) and PSQM99, an enhanced version of PSQM. PESQ is expected to become a new ITU-T recommendation P.862, replacing P.861 which specified PSQM and MNB.},

This paper describes the motivation for the corpus, the processes undertaken in its construction and the utilities needed as support tools. All utterance transcriptions have been verified and a phonetic dictionary has been developed to cover the training data and evaluation tasks. Two evaluation tasks have been defined using standard 5000 word bigram and 20000 word trigram language models. The paper concludes with comparative results on these tasks for British and American English},

One possible role of oscillatory activity is to assure the maintenance of information in working memory (WM). Here we review the possibility that rhythmic activity at theta, alpha, and gamma frequencies serve distinct functional roles during WM maintenance. Specifically, we propose that gamma-band oscillations are generically involved in the maintenance of WM information. By contrast, alpha-band activity reflects the active inhibition of task-irrelevant information, whereas theta-band oscillations underlie the organization of sequentially ordered WM items. Finally, we address the role of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in enabling alpha\textendash gamma and theta\textendash gamma codes for distinct WM information.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an efficient parameterization of the Room Transfer Function (RTF). Typically, the RTF rapidly varies with varying source and receiver positions, hence requires an impractical number of point to point measurements to characterize a given room. Therefore, we derive a novel RTF parameterization that is robust to both receiver and source variations with the following salient features: (i) The parameterization is given in terms of a modal expansion of 3D basis functions. (ii) The aforementioned modal expansion can be truncated at a finite number of modes given that the source and receiver locations are from two sizeable spatial regions, which are arbitrarily distributed. (iii) The parameter weights/coefficients are independent of the source/receiver positions. Therefore, a finite set of coefficients is shown to be capable of accurately calculating the RTF between any two arbitrary points from a predefined spatial region where the source(s) lie and a pre-defined spatial region where the receiver(s) lie. A practical method to measure the RTF coefficients is also provided, which only requires a single microphone unit and a single loudspeaker unit, given that the room characteristics remain stationary over time. The accuracy of the above parameterization is verified using appropriate simulation examples.}

Unlike the classical LMS adaptive filtering scheme, the proposed method is designed to cancel out the clean speech signal. This method takes advantage of the quasi-periodic nature of the speech signal to form an estimate of the clean speech signal at time t from the value of the signal at time t minus the estimated pitch period. For additive white noise distortion, preliminary tests indicate that the method improves the perceived speech quality and increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by 7 dB in a 0 dB environment. The method has also been shown to partially remove the perceived granularity of CVSD coded speech signals and to lead to an improvement in the linear prediction analysis/synthesis of noisy speech.},

As such, any sources of variability not taken into account by the model will affect the metric's performance. In this paper, we investigate two sources of variability in the auditory-inspired model used by the speech-to-reverberation modulation energy ratio (SRMR) metric, namely speech content and pitch, and propose two updates that aim to reduce the variability caused by these sources. First, we limited the dynamic range of the energies in the modulation spectrum bands in order to reduce the effect of speech content and speaker variability. Second, the range of the modulation filter bank was modified to reduce the variability due to pitch. Experimental results show that the updated metric presents higher performance and lower variability relative to the original SRMR when assessing speech intelligibility in noisy and reverberant environments, as well as outperforms several standard intrusive and non-intrusive benchmark metrics.},

  abstract = {Real-time blind reverberation time estimation is of interest in speech enhancement techniques such as e.g. dereverberation and microphone beamforming. Advances in this field have been made where the diffusive reverberation tail is modeled and the decay rate is estimated using a maximum-likelihood approach. Various methods for reducing the computational complexity have also been presented. This paper proposes a method for even further computational complexity reduction, by more than 60\% in some cases, and it is shown through simulations that the results of the proposed method are very similar to that of the original.},

  abstract = {Several approaches for blind estimation of reverberation time have been presented in the literature and decay rate estimation is an integral part of many, if not all, of such approaches. This paper provides both an analytical and experimental comparison, in terms of the bias and variance of three common decay rate estimators; a straight-forward linear regression approach as well as two maximum-likelihood based methods. Situations with and without interfering additive noise are considered. It is shown that the linear regression based approach is unbiased if no smoothing is applied, and that the estimation variance in the absence of noise is constantly about twice that of the maximum-likelihood based methods. It is shown that the methods that do not take possible noise into account suffer from similar estimation bias in the presence of noise. Further, a hybrid method, combining the noise robustness and low computational complexity advantages of the two different maximum-likelihood based methods, is presented.},

In this work, we derive a novel multichannel estimator for the power spectral densities (PSDs) of the reverberation and the speech suitable also for noisy environments. The speech and reverberation PSDs are estimated from all the entries of the received signals power spectral density (PSD) matrix. The Frobenius norm of a general error matrix is minimized to find the best fitting PSDs. Experimental results show that the proposed estimator provides accurate estimates of the PSDs, and is outperforming competing estimators. Moreover, when used in a multi-microphone noise reduction and dereverberation algorithm, the estimated reverberation and speech PSDs are shown to provide improved performance measures as compared with the competing estimators.},

We have identified a similar route in the human for understanding intelligible speech. Using PET imaging to identify separable neural subsystems within the human auditory cortex, we used a variety of speech and speech-like stimuli with equivalent acoustic complexity but varying intelligibility. We have demonstrated that the left superior temporal sulcus responds to the presence of phonetic information, but its anterior part only responds if the stimulus is also intelligible. This novel observation demonstrates a left anterior temporal pathway for speech comprehension.},

  abstract = {Reverberation, especially in large rooms, severely degrades speech recognition performance and speech intelligibility. Since direct measurement of room characteristics is usually not possible, blind estimation of reverberation-related metrics such as the reverberation time (RT) and the direct-to-reverberant energy ratio (DRR) can be valuable information to speech recognition and enhancement algorithms operating in enclosed environments. The objective of this work is to evaluate the performance of five variants of blind RT and DRR estimators based on a modulation spectrum representation of reverberant speech with single- and multi-channel speech data. These models are all based on variants of the so-called Speech-to-Reverberation Modulation Energy Ratio (SRMR). We show that these measures outperform a state-of-the-art baseline based on maximum-likelihood estimation of sound decay rates in terms of root-mean square error (RMSE), as well as Pearson correlation. Compared to the baseline, the best proposed measure, called NSRMR{$\dottedsquare$}\textsubscript{k}, achieves a 23\% relative improvement in terms of RMSE and allows for relative correlation improvements ranging from 13\% to 47\% for RT prediction.},

The finite spatial resolution enforced by the microphone configuration restricts the available frequency bandwidth and, accordingly, modifies the per- ceived timbre of the played-back material. This paper presents a feasibility study investigating the use of filters to correct such spectral artifacts. Listening tests are employed to gain a better understanding of how equalization affects externalization, source focus and timbre. Preliminary results suggest that timbre correction filters improve both timbral and spatial perception.},

  abstract = {Humans can recognize approximate room size using only binaural audition. However, sound reverberation is not negligible in most environments. The reverberation causes temporal fluctuations in the short-term interaural phase differences (IPDs) of sound pressure. This study proposes a novel method for a binaural humanoid robot head to estimate room volume. The method is based on the statistical properties of the short-term IPDs of sound pressure. The humanoid robot turns its head toward a sound source, recognizes the sound source, and then estimates the ego-centric distance by its stereovision. By interpolating the relations between room volume, average standard deviation, and ego-centric distance experimentally obtained for various rooms in a prepared database, the room volume was estimated by the binaural audition of the robot from the average standard deviation of the short-term IPDs at the estimated distance.},

We also propose a computationally inexpensive online maximum likelihood (ML) parameter estimation algorithm for G{$\Gamma$}D. Likelihoods, coefficients of variation (CVs), and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests show that G{$\Gamma$}D can model the distribution of the real speech signal more accurately than the conventional Gaussian, Laplacian, Gamma, or generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD).},

  abstract = {Methods and systems for detecting the presence and frequency of clipping in an audio signal are provided. A clipping detection algorithm detects the presence of hard and soft clipping using histograms with intervals of samples, rather than attempting to identify the clipping value. Therefore, it is not essential to the algorithm that there be a large number of bins. Furthermore, the bins may be non-uniformly distributed since the number of samples belonging to lower amplitudes is of little importance. The detection algorithm is also configured to determine the severity and/or perceptual effect of any clipping found to be present in the signal by calculating the ratio of clipped samples to non-clipped samples. Temporal information on the occurrence of clipping in the signal is also used to evaluate perceptual effect.},

  abstract = {The impulse response of an acoustical space or transducer is one of their most important characterization. In order to perform the measurement of their impulse responses, four of the most suited methods are compared : MLS (Maximum Length Sequence), IRS (Inverse Repeated Sequence), Time-Stretched Pulses and SineSweep. These different methods have already been described in the literature. Nevertheless, the choice of one of these methods depending on the measurement conditions is critical. Therefore, an extensive comparison has been realized. This comparison has been done through the implementation and realization of a complete, fast, reliable and cheap measurement system. Finally, a conclusion for the use of each method according to the principal measurment conditions is presented. It is shown that in the presence of non white noise, the MLS and IRS techniques seem to be more accurate. On the contrary, in quiet environments the Logarithmic SineSweep method seems to be the most appropriate.},

  abstract = {This thesis develops and applies Bayesian model selection and inversion approaches to acoustic seabed scattering and re ectivity data to estimate scattering and geoacoustic parameters with uncertainties, and to discriminate the relative importance of interface and volume scattering mechanisms. Determining seabed scattering mechanisms and parameters is important for reverberation modelling and sonar performance predictions. This thesis shows that remote acoustic sensing can provide efficient estimates of scattering properties and mechanisms with uncertainties, and is well suited for the development of bottom-scattering databases. An important issue in quantitative nonlinear inversion is model selection, i.e., specifying the physical theory, appropriate parameterization, and error statistics which describe the system of interest (acoustic scattering and re ection). The approach developed here uses trans-dimensional (trans-D) Bayesian sampling for both the number of sediment layers and the order (zeroth or first) of auto-regressive parameters in the error model. The scattering and re ection data are inverted simultaneously and the Bayesian sampling is conducted using a population of interacting Markov chains. The data are modelled using homogeneous fluid sediment layers overlying an elastic basement. The scattering model assumes a randomly rough water-sediment interface and random sediment-layer volume heterogeneities with statistically independent von Karman spatial power spectra. A Dirichlet prior distribution that allows the sediment layers and basement to have different numbers of parameters in a trans-D inversion is derived and implemented. The deviance information criterion and trans-D sampling are used to determine the dominant scattering mechanism for a particular data set. The inversion procedure is developed and validated through several simulated test cases, which demonstrate the following. (i) Including re ection data in joint inversion with scattering data improves the resolution and accuracy of scattering and geoacoustic parameters. (ii) The trans-D auto-regressive model improves scattering parameter resolution and correctly differentiates between strongly and weakly correlated residual errors. (iii) Joint scattering/re ection inversion is able to distinguish between interface and volume scattering as the dominant mechanism. The inversion procedure is applied to data measured at several survey sites on the Malta Plateau (Mediterranean Sea) to estimate in-situ seabed scattering and geoacoustic parameters with uncertainties. Results are considered in terms of marginal posterior probability distributions and profiles, which quantify the effective datainformation content to resolve scattering geoacoustic structure. At the first site scattering was assumed (a priori) to be dominated by interface roughness. The inversion results indicate well-defined roughness parameters in good agreement with existing measurements, and a multi-layer sediment profile over a highspeed (elastic) basement, consistent with independent knowledge of sand layers over limestone. At the second site no assumptions were made about the scattering mechanism. The deviance information criterion indicated volume scattering to be the dominant scattering mechanism. The scattering parameters and geoacoustic profile are well resolved. The parameters and preference for volume scattering are consistent with a core extracted at the site which indicated a sediment layer which included large (0.1 m) stones underlying {$\sim$}1 m of mud at the seafloor.},

  abstract = {Abstract Slow neural oscillations (~1-15 Hz) are thought to orchestrate the neural processes of spoken language comprehension. However, functional subdivisions within this broad range of frequencies are disputed, with most studies hypothesizing only about single frequency bands. The present study utilizes an established paradigm of spoken word recognition (lexical decision) to test the hypothesis that within the slow neural oscillatory frequency range, distinct functional signatures and cortical networks can be identified at least for theta- (~ 3-7 Hz) and alpha-frequencies (~8-12 Hz). Listeners performed an auditory lexical decision task on a set of items that formed a word,\"A\`ipseudoword continuum: ranging from (1) real words over (2) ambiguous pseudowords (deviating from real words only in one vowel; comparable to natural mispronunciations in speech) to (3) pseudowords (clearly deviating from real words by randomized syllables). By means of time-frequency analysis and spatial filtering, we observed a dissociation into distinct but simultaneous patterns of alpha power suppression and theta power enhancement. Alpha exhibited a parametric suppression as items increasingly matched real words, in line with lowered functional inhibition in a left-dominant lexical processing network for more word-like input. Simultaneously, theta power in a bilateral fronto-temporal network was selectively enhanced for ambiguous pseudowords only. Thus, enhanced alpha power can neurally `gate' lexical integration, while enhanced theta power might index functionally more specific ambiguity-resolution processes. To this end, a joint analysis of both frequency bands provides neural evidence for parallel processes in achieving spoken word recognition.},

Recently, many new algorithms have been proposed and significant progress in noise tracking has been made. In this paper, we present an evaluation framework for measuring the performance of some recently proposed and some well-known noise power spectral density estimators and compare their performance in adverse acoustic environments. In this investigation we do not only consider the performance in the mean of a spectral distance measure but also evaluate the variance of the estimators as the latter is related to undesirable fluctuations also known as musical noise. By providing a variety of different non-stationary noises, the robustness of noise estimators in adverse environments is examined.},

Moreover, information about the RT can be used to improve the performance of automatic speech recognition systems and speech dereverberation algorithms. In a recent study, it has been shown that existing methods for blind estimation of the RT are highly sensitive to additive noise. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to blindly estimate the RT based on the decay rate distribution. Firstly, a data-driven representation of the underlying decay rates of several training rooms is obtained via the eigenvalue decomposition of a specially-tailored kernel. Secondly, the representation is extended to a room under test and used to estimate its decay rate (and hence its RT). The presented results show that the proposed method outperforms a competing method and is significantly more robust to noise.},

The focus is on the methods that can be used for detecting reflections and the methods that estimate the direction of arrival. Three methods for both tasks are given and their performance is measured using simulated data. Finally an example in a real auditorium is shown using the most reliable methods for detecting and estimating the direction of arrival of the reflections.},

  abstract = {Extracting sound sources in noisy and reverberant conditions remains a challenging task that is commonly found in modern communication systems. In this work, we consider the problem of obtaining a desired spatial response for at most L simultaneously active sound sources. The proposed spatial filter is obtained by minimizing the diffuse plus self-noise power at the output of the filter subject to L linear constraints. In contrast to earlier works, the L constraints are based on instantaneous narrowband direction-of-arrival estimates. In addition, a novel estimator for the diffuse-to-noise ratio is developed that exhibits a sufficiently high temporal and spectral resolution to achieve both dereverberation and noise reduction. The presented results demonstrate that an optimal tradeoff between maximum white noise gain and maximum directivity is achieved.},

  abstract = {The design of time-invariant beamformers is often posed as an optimization problem using practical design constraints. In many scenarios it is sufficient to assume that the microphones have an omnidirectional directivity pattern, a flat frequency response in the range of interest, and a 2D environment in which wavefronts propagate as a function of azimuth angle only. In this paper we consider a generalized solution for those cases in which one or more of these assumptions do not hold, yielding a beamformer that is optimized on measured directivity patterns as a function of azimuth, elevation and frequency. A comparative study is made with the 4-element cardioid microphone array employed in Microsoft Kinect for Windows, whose beamformer weights are calculated with directivity patterns using (a) 2D cardioid models, (b) 3D cardioid models and (c) 3D measurements. Results on a recorded noisy speech corpus show similar PESQ and speech recognition accuracy comparing (a) and (b), but a 50\% relative improvement in word error rate using measured directivity patterns.

Using a frequency domain formulation, it is first shown that a channel can be identified by the second-order statistics of the observation if and only if the channel transfer function does not have special uniformly spaced zeros. This condition leads to several necessary and sufficient conditions on the observation spectra and the channel impulse response. Based on the frequency-domain formulation, a new identification algorithm is proposed}

  abstract = {Signals recorded by microphones form the basis for a wide range of audio signal processing systems. In some applications, such as humanoid robots, the microphones may be moving while recording the audio signals. A common practice is to assume that the microphone is stationary within a short time frame. Although this assumption may be reasonable under some conditions, there is currently no theoretical framework that predicts the level of signal distortion due to motion as a function of system parameters. This paper presents such a framework, for linear and circular microphone motion, providing upper bounds on the motion-induced distortion, and showing that the dependence of this upper bound on motion speed, signal frequency, and time-frame duration, is linear. A simulation study of a humanoid robot rotating its head while recording a speech signal validates the theoretical results.}

  abstract = {The algorithm described here, called OptQuest/NLP or OQNLP, is a heuristic designed to find global optima for pure and mixed integer nonlinear problems with many constraints and variables, where all problem functions are differentiable with respect to the continuous variables. It uses OptQuest, a commercial implementation of scatter search developed by OptTek Systems, Inc., to provide starting points for any gradient-based local solver for nonlinear programming (NLP) problems. This solver seeks a local solution from a subset of these points, holding discrete variables fixed. The procedure is motivated by our desire to combine the superior accuracy and feasibility-seeking behavior of gradient-based local NLP solvers with the global optimization abilities of OptQuest. Computational results include 155 smooth NLP and mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP) problems due to Floudas et al. (1999), most with both linear and nonlinear constraints, coded in the GAMS modeling language. Some are quite large for global optimization, with over 100 variables and 100 constraints. Global solutions to almost all problems are found in a small number of local solver calls, often one or two.}

This method is based on the concept of the modulation transfer function MTF and does not require that the impulse response of an environment be measured. However this basic method has the following problems: (i) how to precisely extract the power envelope from the observed signal; (ii) how to determine the parameters of the impulse response of the room acoustics; and (iii) a lack of consideration as to whether the MTF concept can be applied to a more realistic signal. This paper improves this basic method with regard to these problems in order to extend this method as a first step towards the development for speech applications. We have carried out 1,500 simulations for restoring the power envelope from reverberant signals in which the power envelopes are three types of sinusoidal, harmonics, and band-limited noise and the carriers are white noise, to evaluate our improved method with regard to (i) and (ii). We then have carried out the same simulations in which the carriers are two types of carrier of white noise or harmonics with regard to (iii). Our results have shown that the improved method can adequately restore the power envelope from a reverberant signal and will be able to be applied for speech envelope restoration.},

We propose an extended filterbank model based on these considerations. We have carried out 15,000 simulations of the power envelope restoration for reverberant speech signals, and our results have shown that the proposed model can adequately restore the power envelopes in all channels from reverberant speech signals. We also found that the estimation of the reverberation time should be done separately in each channel to improve the restoration accuracy of the power envelope.},

This method estimates the reverberation time from the reverberant signal without measuring room acoustics. In the MTF-based speech dereverberation method, proposed by the authors, a process for estimating a parameter related to the reverberation time was incorporated. In this paper, we investigate whether the estimation process, previously presented by authors, works as a blind estimation method and point out a problem with their method. We then propose a new method for blindly estimating the reverberation time to resolve the problem. In the proposed method, the reverberation time is correctly estimated by inverse-MTF filtering in the modulation frequency domain. We evaluated the proposed method with their method using both artificial MTF-based signals and speech signals to show how well the proposed method correctly estimates the reverberation time in artificial reverberant environments. Results suggested that the proposed method correctly estimates reverberation times from the observed reverberant signals.},

Such a capability can help localizing a person or an interesting event in the environment, and also provides enhanced processing for other capabilities such as speech recognition. To give this capability to a robot, the challenge is not only to localize simultaneous sound sources, but to track them over time. In this paper we propose a robust sound source localization and tracking method using an array of eight microphones. The method is based on a frequency-domain implementation of a steered beamformer along with a particle filter-based tracking algorithm. Results show that a mobile robot can localize and track in real-time multiple moving sources of different types over a range of 7m. These new capabilities allow a mobile robot to interact using more natural means with people in real-life settings.},

This paper presents a method to measure the reverberation time from two microphone signals. The analysis is based on locating suitable sound segments for RT analysis by using short-time energy and inter-channel coherence measures, followed by the Schroeder integration method, line fitting and finally statistical analysis. The line fitting is used to estimate the slope of the decay. In this paper, we propose a method where the slope is estimated in the region that maximizes the correlation coefficient of the least squares method. This makes the estimation results more accurate than if fixed limits, e.g., -5 to -25 dB on the decay curve, were used, thanks to the absence of the systematic error caused by bending of the decay curves. The system performance was evaluated using a real-time version of the algorithm.},

The accuracy is best in the frontal direction and poorer in the sides, due to shadowing of the head. However, the system shows promise for scenarios where the sound source location is restricted and could be integrated with a two-channel azimuth localization system.},

Based on white noise as the training data, a coherence profile is obtained at each desired position in the room. These profiles can then be used to identify the most likely distance of a speech signal in the same room. The proposed approach is compared to a previous method for learning the position of a sound source. The results indicate that the both methods are able to identify the distance of a speech sound source correctly in a grid with 0.5-m spacing in most cases, when the orientation of the listener is 0deg , 30deg , 60deg , 90deg , or 180deg on the horizontal plane.},

  abstract = {To investigate harmonic distortions of clipped speech, the speech waves are replaced by a sum of two sine waves. Infinite clipping of these two frequencies results in a harmonic distortion of 75\%. If the audioband is modulated to a higher frequency range, one of the sidebands clipped, and all distortions beyond the single band width suppressed, the distortion drops to 50\%. Distortion is further reduced if the original representative sum of the sine waves is differentiated and transformed to a pulse wave with pulse width modulation, the width corresponding to amplitude maximums and minimums. With pulse width modulation of unit amplitude, the advantages of normal clipped speech transmission are retained. On the receiver side the pulse width modulation is transformed to a pulse amplitude modulation with relatively short pulses. The pulse wave, still highly distorted is applied to a storage device (e.g., a magnetic tape or a ladder network of condensers). The picture of the pulses is smoothed and approximates the picture of the original sum of the two sine waves. Essentially, the approximation is the replacement of the original wave by a triangular one. This process, mathematically seen as a sine modulation of an unit triangular curve, reduced harmonic distortions to 12\% instead of 75\% as in normal infinite clipping.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of single channel speech enhancement at very low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) ({$<$}10 dB). The proposed approach is based on the introduction of an auditory model in a subtractive-type enhancement process. Single channel subtractive-type algorithms are characterized by a tradeoff between the amount of noise reduction, the speech distortion, and the level of musical residual noise, which can be modified by varying the subtraction parameters. Classical algorithms are usually limited to the use of fixed optimized parameters, which are difficult to choose for all speech and noise conditions. A new computationally efficient algorithm is developed based on masking properties of the human auditory system. It allows for an automatic adaptation in time and frequency of the parametric enhancement system, and finds the best tradeoff based on a criterion correlated with perception. This leads to a significant reduction of the unnatural structure of the residual noise. Objective and subjective evaluation of the proposed system is performed with several noise types form the Noisex-92 database, having different time-frequency distributions. The application of objective measures, the study of the speech spectrograms, as well as subjective listening tests, confirm that the enhanced speech is more pleasant to a human listener. Finally, the proposed enhancement algorithm is tested as a front-end processor for speech recognition in noise, resulting in improved results over classical subtractive-type algorithms.},

It is simple to implement, can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm. On the first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does. The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions. We describe different graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral clustering algorithms are discussed.},

This paper considers the problem of 3D range location and attempt to improve the altitude estimate. We firstly use a volume formula of tetrahedron to transform the range measurements to volume measurements, then a new pseudo-linear solution is proposed based on the linear relationship between the rectangular and volume coordinates. Theory analysis and numerical examples are included to show the improved accuracy of altitude estimate of mobile location. Finally, an improved estimate of 3D mobile location is given by solving a set of augmented linear equations.},

An adaptive pause detection method is also presented to adapt to various background and environment. Three feature sets, which include pause, rate of speech and prosody, are used to discriminate the sentence boundary. Experiments on broadcasting news indicate that the performance of proposed algorithm is satisfying.},

  abstract = {Abstract Human magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) are capable of tracking brain activity at millisecond temporal resolution in an entirely non-invasive manner, a feature that offers unique opportunities to uncover the spatiotemporal dynamics of the hearing brain. In general, precise synchronisation of neural activity within as well as across distributed regions is likely to subserve any cognitive process, with auditory cognition being no exception. Brain oscillations, in a range of frequencies, are a putative hallmark of this synchronisation process. Embedded in a larger effort to relate human cognition to brain oscillations, a field of research is emerging on how synchronisation within, as well as between, brain regions may shape auditory cognition. Combined with much improved source localisation and connectivity techniques, it has become possible to study directly the neural activity of auditory cortex with unprecedented spatio-temporal fidelity and to uncover frequency-specific long-range connectivities across the human cerebral cortex. In the present review, we will summarise recent contributions mainly of our laboratories to this emerging domain. We present (1) a more general introduction on how to study local as well as interareal synchronisation in human M/EEG; (2) how these networks may subserve and influence illusory auditory perception (clinical and non-clinical) and (3) auditory selective attention; and (4) how oscillatory networks further reflect and impact on speech comprehension.

Here spectral variation, a dominating physical acoustic property for colouration, and its relationship to the colouration perception was studied. A method for converting colouration specified in the bark-sone domain back to the operational magnitude-frequency domain was next formulated. A colouration space was then derived from common factor analysis using both verbal attributes from listening tests and colouration generation control parameters. The results show that one of the two dimensions of the colouration space was intuitively explainable and matches well with the control parameter.},

Its value can be used to predict speech intelligibility, and is used by speech enhancement techniques to suppress reverberation. The reverberation time is usually obtained by analysing the decay rate of i) the energy decay curve that is observed when a noise source is switched off, and ii) the energy decay curve of the room impulse response. Estimating the reverberation time using only the observed reverberant speech signal, i.e., blind estimation, is required for speech evaluation and enhancement techniques. Recently, (semi) blind methods have been developed. Unfortunately, these methods are not very accurate when the source consists of a human speaker, and unnatural speech pauses are required to detect and/or track the decay. In this paper we extract and analyse the decay rate of the energy envelope blindly from the observed reverberation speech signal in the short-time Fourier transform domain. We develop a method to estimate the reverberation time using a property of the distribution of the decay rates. Experimental results using simulated and real reverberant speech signals demonstrate the performance of the new method.},

The parameter likelihood equations (LEs) can possess no solution or several solutions, and the Newton-Raphson method is, in general, poorly behaved when applied to the LEs. This paper describes an algorithm which uses a heuristic root isolation method to circumvent these difficulties. The algorithm can be used to determine the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the GGD or to indicate that none exists.},

In this way, prior regularisation may induce a parsimonious, meaningful representation of the underlying audio time series.},

Based on these models the optimization problem is solved in the maximum a posteriori sense. It is shown that the performance of speech recognition systems in non-stationary noise scenarios is improved considerably compared to the performance achieved with a Wiener filter applied to the beamformer output.}

  abstract = {Speech comprehension in multitalker situations is a notorious real-life challenge, particularly for older listeners. Younger listeners exploit stimulus-inherent acoustic detail, but are they also actively predicting upcoming information? And further, how do older listeners deal with acoustic and predictive information? To understand the neural dynamics of listening difficulties and according listening strategies, we contrasted neural responses in the alpha-band (~10 Hz) in younger (20-30 years, n = 18) and healthy older (60-70 years, n = 20) participants under changing task demands in a two-talker paradigm. Electroencephalograms were recorded while humans listened to two spoken digits against a distracting talker and decided whether the second digit was smaller or larger. Acoustic detail (temporal fine structure) and predictiveness (the degree to which the first digit predicted the second) varied orthogonally. Alpha power at widespread scalp sites decreased with increasing acoustic detail (during target digit presentation) but also with increasing predictiveness (in-between target digits). For older compared with younger listeners, acoustic detail had a stronger impact on task performance and alpha power modulation. This suggests that alpha dynamics plays an important role in the changes in listening behavior that occur with age. Last, alpha power variations resulting from stimulus manipulations (of acoustic detail and predictiveness) as well as task-independent overall alpha power were related to subjective listening effort. The present data show that alpha dynamics is a promising neural marker of individual difficulties as well as age-related changes in sensation, perception, and comprehension in complex communication situations. \textcopyright 2015 the authors.},

  abstract = {Jitter and shimmer voice quality features have been successfully used to characterize speaker voice traits and detect voice pathologies. Jitter and shimmer measure variations in the fundamental frequency and amplitude of speaker's voice, respectively. Due to their nature, they can be used to assess differences between speakers. In this paper, we investigate the usefulness of these voice quality features in the task of speaker diarization. The combination of voice quality features with the conventional spectral features, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), is addressed in the framework of Augmented Multiparty Interaction (AMI) corpus, a multi-party and spontaneous speech set of recordings. Both sets of features are independently modeled using mixture of Gaussians and fused together at the score likelihood level. The experiments carried out on the AMI corpus show that incorporating jitter and shimmer measurements to the baseline spectral features decreases the diarization error rate in most of the recordings.},

Features are used as input to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier combined with a simple decision rule that attributes a specific RT60 to a given utterance and allows to assess the reliability of the approach for different resolutions of RT60 classification. While the filter set including temporal, spectral, and spectro-temporal filters already outperforms an MFCC baseline, the error rates are further reduced when relying on diagonal spectro-temporal filters alone. The average error rate is 1.9\% for the best feature set, which corresponds to a relative reduction of 58.3\% compared to the MFCC baseline for RT60s in 0.1 s resolution.},

In this work, a novel approach is proposed for joint estimation of T60 and DRR from wideband speech in noisy conditions. 2D Gabor filters arranged in a filterbank are exploited for extracting features, which are then used as input to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The MLP output neurons correspond to specific pairs of (T60,DRR) estimates; the output is integrated over time, and a simple decision rule results in our estimate. The approach is applied to single-microphone fullband speech signals provided by the Acoustic Characterization of Environments (ACE) Challenge. Our approach outperforms the baseline systems with median errors of close-to-zero and -1.5 dB for the T60 and DRR estimates, respectively, while the calculation of estimates is 5.8 times faster compared to the baseline.},

  abstract = {This paper presents extended techniques aiming at the improvement of automatic speech recognition (ASR) in single-channel scenarios in the context of the REVERB (REverberant Voice Enhancement and Recognition Benchmark) challenge. The focus is laid on the development and analysis of ASR front-end technologies covering speech enhancement and feature extraction. Speech enhancement is performed using a joint noise reduction and dereverberation system in the spectral domain based on estimates of the noise and late reverberation power spectral densities (PSDs). To obtain reliable estimates of the PSDs---even in acoustic conditions with positive direct-to-reverberation energy ratios (DRRs)---we adopt the statistical model of the room impulse response explicitly incorporating DRRs, as well in combination with a novel proposed joint estimator for the reverberation time T 60 and the DRR. The feature extraction approach is inspired by processing strategies of the auditory system, where an amplitude modulation filterbank is applied to extract the temporal modulation information. These techniques were shown to improve the REVERB baseline in our previous work. Here, we investigate if similar improvements are obtained when using a state-of-the-art ASR framework, and to what extent the results depend on the specific architecture of the back-end. Apart from conventional Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-hidden Markov model (HMM) back-ends, we consider subspace GMM (SGMM)-HMMs as well as deep neural networks in a hybrid system. The speech enhancement algorithm is found to be helpful in almost all conditions, with the exception of deep learning systems in matched training-test conditions. The auditory feature type improves the baseline for all system architectures. The relative word error rate reduction achieved by combining our front-end techniques with current back-ends is 52.7\% on average with the REVERB evaluation test set compared to our original REVERB result.},

Speech signals can be modelled using an autoregressive process in the time-frequency modulation domain, and Kalman filtering based speech enhancement algorithms have been developed for single-channel processing. In this paper, a multichannel Kalman filter (MKF) for speech enhancement is derived that jointly considers the multichannel spatial information and the temporal correlations of speech. We model the temporal evolution of speech in the modulation domain and, by incorporating the spatial information, an optimal MKF gain is derived in the short-time Fourier transform domain. We also show that the proposed MKF becomes a conventional multichannel Wiener filter if the temporal information is discarded. Experiments using the signals generated from a public head-related impulse response database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to other techniques.}

  abstract = {Compared with single-channel speech enhancement methods, multichannel methods can utilize spatial information to design optimal filters. Although some filters adaptively consider second-order signal statistics, the temporal evolution of the speech spectrum is usually neglected. By using linear prediction (LP) to model the inter-frame temporal evolution of speech, single-channel Kalman filtering (KF) based methods have been developed for speech enhancement. In this paper, we derive a multichannel KF (MKF) that jointly uses both interchannel spatial correlation and interframe temporal correlation for speech enhancement. We perform LP in the modulation domain, and by incorporating the spatial information, derive an optimal MKF gain in the short-time Fourier transform domain. We show that the proposed MKF reduces to the conventional multichannel Wiener filter if the LP information is discarded. Furthermore, we show that, under an appropriate assumption, the MKF is equivalent to a concatenation of the minimum variance distortion response beamformer and a single-channel modulation-domain KF and therefore present an alternative implementation of the MKF. Experiments conducted on a public head-related impulse response database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

Commonly used methods are based on the Bayesian information criteria (BIC), which is however not so capable when dealing with short utterances. In this paper, we present a pitch-based speech segmentation method, which can detect frequent speaker changes accurately and rapidly. In our algorithm, pitch is introduced in speaker segmentation. Firstly, utterance segments are detected by pitch. Then distances of pitch are computed, and compared with a self-adaptable threshold. Speaker changes are finally decided among utterance segments. We applied our method and three comparative methods on the HUB4-NE broadcast data. Speaker indexing experiments have been taken following each algorithm. We also suggested two indicators as complements of false alarm and missing rate in the evaluation of segmentation. The experiment results show that our algorithm works faster and better, with most of short time speaker changes detected. Speaker indexing equal error rate of our method is 10.43\%, which is much lower than 12.94\%, 25.84\% and 15.91\% of other methods.},

  abstract = {Although auditory distance perception is a critical component of spatial hearing, it has received substantially less scientific attention than the directional aspects of auditory localization. Here we summarize current knowledge on auditory distance perception, with special emphasis on recent research results. The summary will be structured around three central questions. 1. How accurately can humans estimate the distances of stationary sound sources? We show that this psychophysical relationship is well approximated by a compressive power function, which suggests that listeners systematically underestimate distances to faraway sound sources. 2. What determines perceived sound source distance? We examine the various acoustical and non-acoustical factors thought to contribute to source distance percepts, and summarize the psychophysical literature relevant to each factor. 3. What are the neural correlates to perceived sound source distance? Recent evidence points to the role of areas within right temporal cortex in auditory distance perception, as well as in other spatial tasks in different sensory modalities.},

  abstract = {Wind noise can be a major problem with audio devices such as hearing aids, cochlear implants, phones and headsets. Previous wind-noise detection algorithms generally assume that large level and/or phase differences between two microphones indicate wind noise, while small differences indicate its absence. However, differences may exist without wind noise due to unmatched microphones, acoustic reflections, or the phase shift caused by the microphone spacing. This paper shows that previous algorithms do not always correctly differentiate between wind and non-wind causes of microphone signal differences, which could lead to the inappropriate engagement of wind-noise reduction processing. A novel algorithm is presented, which performs an efficient statistical analysis of the microphone signals that is substantially more robust against non-wind causes differences, and hence false wind-noise detection, in an exemplary hearing-aid application.},

The first stage is called the coarse-level audio classification and segmentation, where audio recordings are classified and segmented into speech, music, several types of environmental sounds, and silence, based on morphological and statistical analysis of temporal curves of short-time features of audio signals. In the second stage, environmental sounds are further classified into finer classes such as applause, rain, bird sound, etc. This fine-level classification is based on time-frequency analysis of audio signals and use of the hidden Markov model (HMM) for classification. In the third stage, the query-by-example audio retrieval is implemented where similar sounds can be found according to an input sample audio. It is shown that the proposed system has achieved an accuracy higher than 90\% for coarse-level audio classification. Examples of audio fine classification and audio retrieval are also provided},

However, noise will degrade such methods greatly. In this paper a new framework is proposed to extend these methods for room parameter extraction from noise-free cases to more realistic noise environment, such as occupied rooms, where noises are generated by occupants. In this proposed framework, blind source separation (BSS) is combined with an adaptive noise canceller (ANC) to remove the noise from the passively received reverberant speech signal. Room acoustic parameters can then be extracted from the output of the ANC with existing 'blind' methods. As a demonstration we will utilize this framework combined with a maximum-likelihood (ML) based method to estimate the RT of a simulated occupied room. Simulation results show that the proposed framework provides a good estimate of the RT in such a simulated occupied room.},

We investigated the manner in which speech streams are represented in brain activity and the way that selective attention governs the brain's representation of speech using a ,`Cocktail Party' paradigm, coupled with direct recordings from the cortical surface in surgical epilepsy patients. We find that brain activity dynamically tracks speech streams using both low-frequency phase and high-frequency amplitude fluctuations and that optimal encoding likely combines the two. In and near low-level auditory cortices, attention `modulates' the representation by enhancing cortical tracking of attended speech streams, but ignored speech remains represented. In higher-order regions, the representation appears to become more `selective' in that there is no detectable tracking of ignored speech. This selectivity itself seems to sharpen as a sentence unfolds.}

Most of the algorithms used in hearing aids are able to extract target signals that are in the look direction of the user and suffer from a reduced performance in localizing sounds received from other directions. Moreover, head-shadowing as well as variations like head movements may lead to significant distortions. The proposed binaural GSC beamformer includes an MMSE-based localization algorithm using an ITD/ILD model and is controlled by an inertial measurement unit. The localization algorithm can effectively localize multiple speakers in the presence of reverberation. The estimated source locations are used to adapt the GSC beamformer which extracts the desired speaker. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the new system and especially the benefits of ILD information.}

  abstract = {The topic of this thesis is relative depth estimation using interferometric sidelooking sonar. We give a thorough description of the geometry of interferometric sonar and of time delay estimation techniques. We present a novel solution for the depth estimate using sidelooking sonar, and review the cross-correlation function, the cross-uncertainty function and the phase-differencing technique. We find an elegant solution to co-registration and unwrapping by interpolating the sonar data in ground-range. Two depth estimation techniques are developed: Cross-correlation based sidescan bathymetry and synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) interferometry. We define flank length as a measure of the horizontal resolution in bathymetric maps and find that both sidescan bathymetry and SAS interferometry achieve theoretical resolutions. The vertical precision of our two methods are close to the performance predicted from the measured coherence. We study absolute phase-difference estimation using bandwidth and find a very simple split-bandwidth approach which outperforms a standard 2D phase unwrapper on complicated objects. We also examine advanced filtering of depth maps. Finally, we present pipeline surveying as an example application of interferometric SAS.},
